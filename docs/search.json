Option 2: Single vs Multi-Tag Composition (Diagnostic View) What it shows: How complex projects are: 1 tag 2 tags 3+ tags Visuals: Simple bar chart or stacked bar Why it helps: Explains why counts exceed the number of projects Justifies more complex visuals Client framing: “About 40% of projects span multiple policy domains, so categories are not mutually exclusive.” Often useful as a methods slide, not a headline result. 4. Option 3: UpSet Plot (Best for Overlap Patterns) What it shows: Which combinations of tags appear together How common each combination is Example combinations: Solar + Utilities Wind (onshore) + Transmission CCS + Pipelines + Utilities Why UpSet works better than Venn diagrams: Scales to many categories Emphasizes observed combinations, not theoretical ones When to use: If the client asks: “What types of projects tend to involve utilities or transmission?” Pros: ✅ Handles many tags ✅ Makes co-occurrence explicit ✅ No double-counting confusion Cons: ❌ Requires a brief explanation ❌ Less familiar to non-technical audiences Great as a second- or third-level figure. 5.

Background\n\nLease/Serial/Case File No.: Grazing Case File Number 2506717\n\nOn May 6, 2016, the Lewistown BLM Field Office received completed transfer of grazing\npreference application forms (4130-1, 4130-1a, 4130-1b and 4120-8) from Joseph C. Bodner\nwith a Deed showing control of the base property. The BLM determined that the applicant\nmeets the qualifications to hold a grazing permit (43 CFR §4110.1) and were deemed to have a\nsatisfactory performance record.\n\nThe proposed action is to approve the 67 AUM transfer of grazing preference in the Nebel\nCoulee (#09665) Allotment from Conrad S. Bodner to Joseph C. Bodner and to issue a new\ngrazing lease.\n\nThe current 10 year term grazing lease expires on February 28, 2019. The renewed lease offered\nto the applicant as a result of this grazing preference transfer will have the same terms and\nconditions as the expiring lease and will be issued for term of 10 years effective March 1, 2017\nand expire February 28, 2027. The renewed lease will be issued in accordance with Section\n402(c)(2) of the Federal Land Policy Management Act (FLPMA) as amended by Public Law No.\n113-291. Leases issued in accordance with Section 402(c)(2) of the FLPMA as amended by\nPublic Law No. 113-291 are not protestable or appealable under the processes described in 43\nCFR §4160 and 43 CFR §4.470 et seq[1]. The following statement will be included in the cover\nletter transmitting the grazing lease issued to continue the terms and conditions of the terminated\nlease and the newly offered lease in accordance with the FLPMA Section 402(c)(2). This\nlanguage will also be included in the lease for tracking purposes but is not a term and condition\nof the lease:\n\n“This permit or lease is issued under the authority of Section 402(c)(2) of FLPMA, 1976 as\namended, and contains the same terms and conditions as the previous permit or lease. This\npermit or lease may be cancelled, suspended, or modified, in whole or in part to meet the\nrequirements of applicable laws and regulations.\"\n\nThe terms and conditions (kind and number of livestock, period of use, area to be used, and\namount of use) of the current term grazing lease are illustrated below. The Nebel Coulee\nAllotment was evaluated in the Snowies-Little Belts Grazing Permit Renewal Environmental\nAssessment (EA #MT-060-08-52) planning process and was determined to be meeting Standards\nfor Rangeland Health and Guidelines for Livestock Grazing Management (1997).

Under\nthe statutes, the BLM is required to develop regulations to manage public land resources on a\nmultiple-use and sustained yield basis. Management of grazing on BLM land within the\nplanning area will be in accordance with the grazing administration regulations found in 43\nCFR Part 4100. The purpose of the grazing regulations is to manage the livestock grazing\nprogram as an integral part of the overall multiple-use of the public lands.”\nStandards for Rangeland Health and Guidelines for Livestock Grazing Management\nEnvironmental Impact Statement (5/1997):\nStandards are statements of physical and biological condition, or degree of function required\nfor healthy sustainable rangelands.

Compliance with NEPA:\n\nThe proposed action is categorically excluded from further documentation under the\nNational Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) in accordance with the following:\n\n[ ] 43 CFR 46.210, or\n[x] 516 DM 11.9\n\nCompliance with FLPMA Section 402(h)(1) Criteria for Application of Categorical Exclusion\nused to Issue a Grazing Permit or Lease:\n\n1. The permit or lease continues the current grazing management of the allotments(s).\n2. A land health assessment and evaluation have been completed in accordance with\nManual Handbook H-4180-1.\n3. The Authorized Officer concludes from the finding of the evaluation report that:\na. The public land subject to the evaluation is meeting land health standards, or\nb. The public land subject to the evaluation is not meeting standards due to\nfactors other than current livestock grazing.\n\nCompliance with IM-2015-121:\n\n1. Existing grazing is consistent with land use plan and any applicable allotment\nmanagement plan objectives and decisions. Most recent Evaluation Report and Land\nHealth Determination and any subsequently collected monitoring data documents that\nthe allotment(s) included in the permit meet land health standards or that factors other\nthan existing livestock grazing are the cause for allotment(s) failing to meet the\nstandards.\n\nAppropriate CX Number and Text, or Paraphrase of the Text:\n\nD. Rangeland Management (1): Approval of transfers of grazing preference.\n\nThe proposed action has been reviewed and none of the extraordinary circumstances described in\n43 CFR 46.215 applies. This categorical exclusion is appropriate in this situation because there\nare no extraordinary circumstances potentially having significant effects on the environment.\n\nExplanation of Why There is no Potential for Significant Impacts:\n1. Have significant impact on public health or safety.\nYes [ ] No [x] Rationale: The proposed action will not have a significant impact on public health or safety\nbecause there are no proposed changes to the grazing permit. The proposed action is an\nadministrative action.\n2. Have significant impact on such natural resources and unique geographic characteristics as historic or\ncultural resources; park, recreation or refuge lands; wilderness areas; wild or scenic rivers; national\nnatural landmarks; sole or principle drinking water aquifers; prime farmlands; wetlands (Executive\nOrder 11991; Floodplains (Executive Order 11988); national monuments; migratory birds; and other\necologically significant or critical areas.\nYes [ ] No [x] Rationale: There are no proposed changes to the current grazing permit. The proposed\naction is an administrative action and therefore, there are no impacts to any of the\naforementioned natural resources because the terms and conditions (kind and number of\nlivestock, period of use, area to be used, and amount of use) of the current term grazing\npermit will remain the same. Since there are no additional changes other than a name\nchange, there will be no change from the baseline for natural resources and no further\nanalysis are warranted.\n3. Have highly controversial environmental effects or involve unresolved conflict concerning alternative\nuses of available resources [NEPA section 102(2)(E)].\nYes [ ] No [x] Rationale: The proposed action is an administrative action and will not have highly\ncontroversial environmental effects or involve unresolved conflict concerning alternative\nuses of available resources because it will not authorize new resource uses beyond what\ncurrently exist. A Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) was signed on July 2009\npertaining to the existing terms and conditions of the permit analyzed in the Snowies-Little\nBelts Grazing Permit Renewal Environmental Assessment (EA #MT-060-08-52).\n4. Have highly uncertain and potentially significant environmental effects or involve unique or unknown\nenvironmental risks.\nYes [ ] No [x] Rationale: The proposed action is an administrative action and would not have highly\nuncertain and potentially significant environmental effects or involve unique or unknown\nenvironment risks because it will not authorize new resource uses beyond what currently\nexist. Based on ID Team review, new circumstances were not identified and the\nconsequences of the proposed action remain certain. A Finding of No Significant Impact\n(FONSI) was signed on July 2009, pertaining to the existing terms and conditions of the\npermit analyzed in the Snowies-Little Belts Grazing Permit Renewal Environmental\nAssessment (EA #MT-060-08-52).\n5. Establish a precedent for future action or represent a decision in principle about future actions with\npotentially significant environmental effects.\nYes [ ] No [x] Rationale: The proposed action is an administrative action and will not establish precedent\nfor future actions and does not represent a decision in principle about future actions with\npotentially significant environmental effects because it complies with current Federal\nRegulations (CFR §4100), The National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, and will not\nauthorize new resource uses beyond what currently exist. A Finding of No Significant Impact\n(FONSI) was signed on July 2009, pertaining to the existing terms and conditions of the\npermit analyzed in the Snowies-Little Belts Grazing Permit Renewal Environmental\nAssessment (EA #MT-060-08-52).\n6. Have a direct relationship to other actions with individually insignificant but cumulative significant\nenvironmental effects.\nYes [ ] No [x] Rationale: The proposed action is an administrative action and does not have a direct\nrelationship to other actions with individually insignificant but cumulative significant\nenvironmental effects. The proposed action is consistent with current Federal Regulations\n(CFR §4100), The National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, and will not authorize new\nresource uses beyond what currently exist. A Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) was\nsigned on July 2009, pertaining to the existing terms and conditions of the permit analyzed\nunder the Snowies-Little Belts Grazing Permit Renewal Environmental Assessment (EA\n#MT-060-08-52).\n7. Have significant impact on properties listed, or eligible for listing, on the National Register of Historic\nPlaces as determined by the bureau.\n\nYes [ ] No [x] Rationale: The proposed action is an administrative name change and will not have\nsignificant impacts on properties listed or eligible for listing, on the National Register of\nHistoric Places as determined by the Bureau due to the lack of known properties eligible for\nor listed on the National Register.\n8. Have significant impacts on species listed, or proposed to be listed, on the List of Endangered or\nThreatened Species or have significant impacts on designated Critical Habitat for these species.\nYes [ ] No [x] Rationale: The proposed action is an administrative name change and will not have\nsignificant impacts on species listed, or proposed to be listed, on the List of Endangered or\nThreatened Species or have significant impacts on designated Critical Habitat for wildlife\nspecies because the terms and conditions (kind and number of livestock, period of use, area\nto be used and amount of use) of the current term grazing permit will remain the same. There\nwill be no change from the baseline for wildlife, T&E Species, or BLM Sensitive Species,\nincluding Greater Sage-Grouse and no further analysis is warranted. A Finding of No\nSignificant Impact was signed on July 2009, pertaining to the existing terms and conditions\nof the permit analyzed under the Snowies-Little Belts Grazing Permit Renewal\nEnvironmental Assessment (EA #MT-060-08-52).\n9. Violate a Federal law, or a State, local, or tribal law or requirement imposed for the protection of the\nenvironment.\nYes [ ] No [x] Rationale: The proposed action is an administrative name change and will not violate a\nFederal law, or a State, local, or tribal law or requirement imposed for the protection of the\nenvironment because it complies with current Federal Regulations (CFR §4100), The\nNational Environmental Policy Act of 1969, and will not authorize new resource uses beyond\nwhat currently exist.\n10. Have a disproportionately high and adverse effect on low income or minority populations (Executive\nOrder 12898).\nYes [ ] No [x] Rationale: The proposed action is an administrative name change and will not have a\ndisproportionately high and adverse effect on low income or minority populations because\nthe proposed action will not authorize new resource uses beyond what currently exist.\n11. Limit access to and ceremonial use of Indian sacred sites on Federal lands by Indian religious\npractitioners or significantly adversely affect the physical integrity of such sacred sites (Executive Order\n13007).\nYes [ ] No [x] Rationale: The proposed action is an administrative name change only and will have no\nimpact to access or ceremonial use, nor will it significantly adversely affect the physical\nintegrity of such sites.\n12. Contribute to the introduction, continued existence, or spread of noxious weeds or non-native invasive\nspecies known to occur in the area or action that may promote the introduction, growth, or expansion of\nthe range of such species (Federal Noxious Weed Control Act and Executive Order 13112).\nYes [ ] No [x] Rationale: The proposed action is an administrative name change and does not contribute to\nthe introduction or spread of noxious weeds.\n\nD: Signature\n\nI considered this review and determined that the proposed action is in conformance with the land\nuse plan and is categorically excluded from further environmental analysis. It is my decision to\napprove the proposed action.\n\nPertinent design features, stipulations or mitigation (if applicable):\n\nAuthorizing Official: Peter G.

Additional acreage for cut/fill slopes and construction are within a\nfenced boundary. EOG also proposes to construct and maintain approximately 130 feet (0.024\nmile) of new access road with a running width of 20 feet and a maximum width of 60 feet (0.18\nacres) needed for construction (Table 1). The well pad construction activities would occur on\nprivate surface estate over off-lease Federal minerals, with horizontal legs producing from\nFederal, and/or state or fee minerals. (Fee-Fee-Fed); while the road construction activities would\noccur on private surface. The horizontal legs would produce from Federal oil and gas leases\nWYW152109 and WYW144682 and WYW153117.\n\nThe water for drilling and completion operations would be pumped to the proposed location from\nthe Dilts 1-20 Water Pits located at T. 40 N, R. 72 W, sec. 20, SESW, Converse County,\nWyoming through a temporary flat line placed in the barrow ditch of existing and proposed\naccess road. If the well were to be productive, facilities would be built on the proposed Ruby\n1819-16H facilities pad. Within six months of well completion, interim reclamation would be\nperformed on the well pad and access road if the proposed well on the location is productive.\n\nIf the well is not productive, it would be plugged, and all disturbance associated with this well\nwould be reclaimed to near natural, or landowner preferred conditions.\n\nFor more details on project area access, design features, construction practices, affected surface\nowners and details regarding reclamation, refer to the Application for Permit to Drill (APDs).\n\nA class III cultural resource inventory for the proposed well location and access road indicates\nthat no eligible cultural resources would be adversely affected by the proposed action. However,\ndue to Fee-Fee-Fed classification, all recommended mitigation measures for wildlife are based\non a GIS desktop review of all available data. In instances where a wildlife resource is not\nrepresented or discounted with GIS data, the wildlife biologist has recommended all mitigation\nmeasures for all wildlife resources that could potentially occur in the area.\n\nThe proposed action is not located within 2 miles of an occupied sage-grouse lek and is located\noutside designated Priority Habitat Management Area (PHMA) (aka Core Area).\n\nThis categorical exclusion (CX) tiers to and incorporates by reference the information and\nanalysis contained in the Converse County Oil and Gas Project Final Environmental Impact\n1\n\nRuby 1819-16H Well Pad\nStatement (EIS), DOI-BLM-WY-P060-2014-0135-EIS and Record of Decision approved\nDecember 23, 2020.\n\nTable 1.

The proposed action is in conformance with the Casper RMP\ndecisions, goals, and objectives.\n\nPublic Involvement\nThe proposed action forms 3160-3 were posted at the Casper Field Office on 4/21/2021. Per\nOnshore Order No. 1 E.1, “The BLM and the Federal Surface Managing Agency, if other than\nthe BLM, must provide at least 30 days public notice before the BLM may approve an\nApplication for Permit to Drill (APD) or Master Development Plan on a Federal oil and gas\nlease. The posting is for informational purposes only and is not an appealable decision. The\npurpose of the posting is to give any interested party notification that a Federal approval of\nmineral operations has been requested.” Due to the location and routine nature of the project,\nexternal scoping beyond the affected parties was not performed. The BLM Casper Field Office\n(CFO) interdisciplinary team (IDT) conducted internal scoping by reviewing the proposal, its\nlocation and a resource (issue) list to identify potentially affected resources, land uses, resource\nissues, regulations and site-specific circumstances. The IDT provided input relative to potential\nimpacts to various resources. This input was used to guide the scope and analysis for this CX.\nThe proposed action was posted to the ePlanning National Register on May 13, 2021.\n\nThe BLM consulted with the following individuals and agencies during the preparation of this\nCX:\n\nThe State Historic Preservation Officer was notified per the State Protocol between the Bureau of\nLand Management Wyoming State Director and the Wyoming State Historic Preservation\nOfficer. This entailed a notification of the finding of No Historic Properties Affected.\n\nNo other agencies, groups or individuals were contacted in the development of this project.\n\nDecision and Rationale for Decision\nIt is my decision to approve the proposed action as conditioned through BLM COAs, RMMs and\napplicant committed BMPs.\n\nI have reviewed DOI-BLM-WY-P060-2021-0162-CX for the Ruby 1819-16H horizontal oil and\ngas well. Conditioned through mitigation measures, I find that this action will not result in\nsignificant impacts on the human environment pursuant to Title 40 Code of Federal Regulations\n1508.27 (a) and (b) (1) through (10).\n\nImplementation Date\nEOG will initiate the proposed action within two years of the APD approval, or within four years\nof the APD approval if a two-year extension is requested and approved.\n\nRight of Protest and/or Appeal\nThis decision is subject to administrative review according to 43 Code of Federal Regulation\n(CFR) 3165. Request for administrative review of this decision must include information\nrequired under 43 CFR 3165.3(b) (State Director Review), including all supporting\ndocumentation. Such a request must be filed in writing with the State Director, Bureau of Land\nManagement, P.O. Box 1828, Cheyenne, Wyoming 82003, no later than 20 business days after\nthis Decision Record is received or considered to have been received. Any party who is\nadversely affected by the State Director's decision may appeal that decision to the Interior Board\nof Land Appeals, as provided in 43 CFR 3165.4.\n\nBENJAMIN BIGALKE Digitally signed by BENJAMIN BIGALKE\nDate: 2021.05.21 09:31:29 -06'00'\nSignature of the Authorized Officer\nBen Bigalke\nActing Field Manager\nDate\n--- END PAGE 3 ---\n\n--- START PAGE 4 ---\nUnited States Department of the Interior\nBureau of Land Management\n\nCategorical Exclusion Not Established By Statute\n\nDOI-BLM-UT-CO30-2017-0046-CX\n\nJuly 2017\n\nSouthwest Extreme LLC\nSpecial Recreation Permit\n\nLocation: Washington County, Utah\n\nThe proposed action would take place on public lands.

Background\n\nCATEGORICAL EXCLUSION DOCUMENTATION FORMAT WHEN USING\nCATEGORICAL EXCLUSIONS NOT ESTABLISHED BYSTATUTE\n\nBLM Office: St. George\n\nLease/Serial Case File No: DOI-BLM-UT-CO30-2017-0046-CX\n\nProposed Action Title/Type: Special Recreation Permit\n\nLocation of Proposed Action: The area of the proposed action includes all of the Sand\nMountain Recreation Area (Open OHV) and all authorized routes on BLM managed lands in\nWashington County that are open to the public for motorized use.\n\nDescription of Proposed Action: Authorize a Special Recreation Permit (SRP) for Southwest\nExtreme LLC for the purpose of guiding clients on Utility Terrain Vehicles (UTV) on\nauthorized roads in the BLM St. George Field Office. The proponent anticipates 75% of their\ntrips would occur in the Sand Mountain Open OHV Area, with the remainder taking place on\nauthorized roads throughout Washington County, including the Beaver Dam Wash and Red\nCliffs National Conservation Areas.\n\nThere would be a maximum group size of twelve UTVs and a minimum group size of four\nUTVs, with a minimum staff to customer ratio of 1:6. Each trip would be 3-6 hours depending\non specific tour location. All tours would occur during daylight hours throughout the year, as\nweather permits. Clients and UTV's would be transported to existing trailheads or staging\nareas by passenger trucks with trailers. Trips would be conducted using UTV's which carry\none driver and one passenger.\n\nNo overnight camping would be authorized on any BLM-managed public lands under this\npermit. All activities would follow Tread Lightly principles. All guides will be experienced\ndrivers and each vehicle will carry a first aid kit. All vehicles will be equipped two-way radios\nto communicate with other vehicles on the tour. In addition, each driver will have a mobile\nphone. Issuance of the permit is dependent on the applicant obtaining BLM mandated minimum\ninsurance.\n\nThis would be a ten-year permit, valid for one year from the date of issuance and eligible for\nannual renewal for an additional nine years if all the conditions are met, stipulations followed,\nand post-use reports and payments made accurately and on time.\n\nB. Land Use Plan Conformance\nLand Use Plan Name: St. George Field Office, Resource Management Plan\n\nDate Approved/Amended: March 1999\nThe proposed action is in conformance with the applicable LUP because it is specifically\nprovided for in the following LUP decision(s):\n\n1. Chapter 2, Recreation Objectives, pages 37,38:\n\"Public lands in Washington County will generally remain open to most forms of outdoor\nrecreation, including, but not limited to: hiking, touring, camping, hunting, picnicking,\nsightseeing, rock hounding, mountain biking, equestrian use, swimming, fishing,\nrafting/kayaking, rock climbing, and various forms of motorized recreation.\"\n\n2. Chapter 2, Off-Highway Vehicle Management, page 50, OV-09:\n\"BLM will continue to work with OHV sponsors and organizations to authorize competitive\nevents, commercial touring, and organized rides on a case-by-case basis, subject to site\nspecific analysis.\n\n3. The SGFO RMP has three OHV designations that are applicable to the proposed action:\nLimited to Existing Roads and Trails, Limited to Designated Roads and Trails, and Open to\nMotorized Vehicle Use. All routes proposed by the applicant are located within these area\ndesignations.\n\n4. The BDWNCA RMP, 6.30 Recreation and Visitor Services, Rec-13, page 58:\nLimit SRPs for motorized commercial and organized group recreation activities to roads and\nprimitive roads authorized for use by the public.\n\n5. The RCNCA RMP, 6.31 Recreation and Visitor Services, Rec-13, page 57:\nLimit SRPs for motorized commercial and organized group recreation activities to roads and\nprimitive roads authorized for use by the public.\n\nC. Compliance with NEPA\nThe Proposed Action is categorically excluded from further documentation under the National\nEnvironmental Policy Act (NEPA) in accordance with 516 DM 11.9, 9 (Actions Eligible for a\nCategorical Exclusion): H (Recreation Management) (1}. This reference states: \"Issuance of\nSpecial Recreation Permits for day use or overnight use up to 14 consecutive nights; that impacts\nnot more than 3 staging area acres; and/or for recreational travel along roads. trails, or in areas\nauthorized in a land use plan.\n\nCategorical Exclusion Review Record\n\nResource | Yes/No* | Assigned Specialist | Date\n| | Signature |\nAir Quality | No | D.

The project would:\n\nExtraordinary Circumstances\n\n1. Have significant impacts on public health or safety.\nYes [ ] No [x] Rationale: The proposed action is identical to non-commercial recreational\nATV/UTV use that regularly occurs in this area. There is no data to suggest that\ndriving on existing roads in the amount and duration proposed would have a large\nimpact on public health or safety.\n\n2. Have significant impacts on such natural resources and unique geographic characteristics as\nhistoric or cultural resources; park, recreation or refuge lands; wilderness areas; wild or scenic\nrivers; national natural landmarks; sole or principal drinking water aquifers; prime farmlands;\nwetlands (Executive Order 11990); floodplains (Executive Order 11988); national monuments;\nmigratory birds; and other ecologically significant or critical areas.\nYes [ ] No [x] Rationale: Roughly, 75% of the proposed recreation use under this SRP would take\nplace in the Sand Mountain Recreation Area, which is classified as \"Open\" for OHV\nuse, meaning there are no restrictions on motorized cross-country travel. The\nremainder of the proposed action would take place on existing roads currently\nmanaged under the area designations \"Limited to Existing Roads and Trails or\n\"Limited to Designated Roads and Trails.\" Because recreational UTV travel under\nthis permit would be restricted to specific roads and\nthose roads are already open to motorized use; no new or adverse impacts to sensitive\nresources are anticipated to occur.\n\n3. Have highly controversial environmental effects or involve unresolved conflicts concerning\nalternative uses of available resources [NEPA section 102 (2) (E)].\nYes [ ] No [x] Rationale: The proposed recreation use would consist of guided UTV rides on\nauthorized roads that are open to the public, with two guided rides per day being\noffered daily throughout the week, with a group size limit of six UTVs including\ntwo guides. This type of action is a small percentage of the public use on these roads\nand would not result in highly controversial environmental effects or create\nunresolved conflicts concerning alternative uses of available resources.\n\n4. Have highly uncertain and potentially significant environmental effects or involve unique or\nunknown environmental risks.\nYes [ ] No [x] Rationale: There is nothing in the proposed action that would lead to significant,\nunknown, or unique environmental risks.\n\n5. Establish a precedent for future action or represent a decision in principal about future actions\nwith potentially significant environmental effects.\nYes [ ] No [x] Rationale: Since each Special Recreation Permit proposal must be evaluated\nindividually, authorizing a single permit does not establish a precedent for future\nactions.\n\nExtraordinary Circumstances\n\n6. Have a direct relationship to other actions with individually insignificant but cumulatively\nsignificant environmental effects.\nYes [ ] No [x] Rationale: Because of the rapidly growing population in Washington County, it is\nreasonable to expect that OHV activity in general, and commercial guiding in\nparticular, will continue to increase. Analyzing cumulative impacts from new\nproposals (both motorized and non-motorized) will continue to be done on a case-by-\ncase basis.\n\nThe St. George Field Office currently has six active Special Recreation Permits for\nguided ATV trips. The combined use from these six permits totals less than one-half\nof one percent of the recreational use on BLM lands in Washington County.\nCumulative impacts may be an issue in the future, but for now they are negligible.\n\n7. Have significant impacts on properties listed, or eligible for listing, on the National Register\nof Historic Places as determined by the bureau.\nYes [ ] No [x] Rationale: Continued use of designated and existing routes and trails, or use of\n\"open\" OHV areas will have no impact on sites eligible for listing to the National\nRegister of Historic Places.\n\n8. Have significant impacts on species listed, or proposed to be listed, on the List of Endangered\nor Threatened Species, or have significant impacts on designated Critical Habitat for these\nspecies.\nYes [ ] No [x] Rationale: No threatened, endangered, or candidate species would be impacted by\nthe proposed action, as all motorized travel would be restricted to existing public\nroads and trails and an \"open\" OHV area. Because motorized travel under this permit\nwould be restricted to specific roads, listed native plants would not be impacted.\n\n9. Violate a Federal law, or a State, local or tribal law or requirement imposed for the protection\nof the environment.\nYes [x] No [ ] Rationale: The proposed action is in compliance with Federal, State, Tribal, and\nlocal laws, and no activities would take place on tribal lands.\n\n10. Have a disproportionately high and adverse effect on low income or minority populations\n(Executive Order 12898).\nYes [ ] No [x] Rationale: The proposed action would have no effect on low income or minority\npopulations.\n\n11. Limit access to and ceremonial use of Indian sacred sites on Federal lands by Indian religious\npractitioners or significantly adversely affect the physical integrity of such sacred sites\n(Executive Order 13007).\n\nExtraordinary Circumstances\nYes [ ] No [x] Rationale: The proposed action would not limit access to, or interfere with\nceremonial use of sacred sites, nor would it adversely impact the integrity of any such\nknown sites.\n\n12. Contribute to the introduction, continued existence, or spread of noxious weeds or non-native\ninvasive species known to occur in the area or actions that may promote the introduction,\ngrowth, or expansion of the range of such species (Federal Noxious Weed Control Act and\nExecutive Order 13112).\nYes [ ] No [x] Rationale: As with any outdoor recreation activity, the proposed action may\ncontribute to the introduction and distribution of invasive species. Guides would be\ngiven information materials to help them identify noxious weeds that may be\nencountered, and they are and asked to report to the SGFO Recreation Planner if any\nare observed. Individual trail and trailheads are inspected annually by BLM staff to\nensure that any new infestations of noxious weeds are identified and controlled.\n\nDecision\nIt is my decision to implement the action described in Categorical Exclusion DOI-BLM-UT-CO30-\n2017-0046-CX\n\nDecision Rationale\nI have reviewed the attached Categorical Exclusion documentation, including plan conformance,\nNEPA compliance review, and extraordinary circumstances review.

This assessment identified lands under BLM administration that were considered \nlacking in the wilderness characteristics as defined by the Wilderness Act of 1964. The \nassessment was conducted in a manner that met the requirements of Section 603 of the Federal \nLand Policy and Management Act of 1976 (FLPMA). \n \nThe action being considered is located within the Sagavanirktok Segment of the Nonwilderness \nAssessment, which covered approximately 512,000 acres total in 1980. Portions of this segment \nmeet the 5,000 acre minimum size. However it was determined that the Sagavanirktok Segment \ndid not meet the standards for naturalness due to roads, camps, airfields, pipelines, material sites \nand associated facilities. These disturbances bisect the entire length of the segment. \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\npages.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndocument_id\npage_number\npage_text\n\n\n\n\n0\n2d9415b3c9309d9670f09501ca618ce3\n1\nColdfoot Cell Tower, F-97066 \\n \\nPage 1 \\n \\nEnvironmental Assessment \\nGCI Coldfoot Cell Tower \\nDOI-BLM-AK-2016-F030-0009-EA \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nBureau of Land Management \\nCentral Yukon Field Office \\n1150 University Avenue \\nFairbanks, Alaska 99709 \\n \\nFebruary 2016 \\n \\n\n\n\n1\n2d9415b3c9309d9670f09501ca618ce3\n2\nColdfoot Cell Tower, F-97066 \\n \\nPage 2 \\n \\n1.

PROPOSED ACTION AND ALTERNATIVES \nDESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSED ACTION \nGCI is proposing to install a communication tower site on public lands near the Coldfoot airport, \nmile post 175 off the Dalton Highway within Sec. 16, T. 28 N., R. 12 W., Fairbanks Meridian, \ncontaining 2.29 acre.  They propose a 20 year authorization with the option of renewal to \nconstruct, operate, maintain, and decommission. \n \nThe facility would provide UMTS (3G) wireless voice and data coverage to the community \nbecause there is none currently.  GCI is proposing to build an unlit, un-guyed, 80-foot-tall lattice \ntower on the parcel. A communications shelter (10 feet by 20 feet) would be secured on the same \n25-foot-by-25-foot I-beam platform as the tower. The I-beam foundation does not require \nexcavation and fill, but there may be a small amount of surface leveling with a bulldozer. The \nproject would also involve construction of the following: \n \n• Wireless technology cabinets housed in the communications shelter – the cabinets would \ncontain 850 MHz CDMA/EVEO, 850 MHz UMTS and 700 MHz LTE, DC rectifiers and \nbattery backup plant. This shelter would not require a back-up generator. \n \n• An aerial “ice bridge” between the communication shelter and the tower – the ice bridge \nwould provide a structure for attaching the coaxial transmission lines and offer protection \nfrom falling ice. This would not involve ground disturbance because the ice bridge would \nbe constructed on the I-beam ballast tower foundation. \n \n• An extension of the existing chain-link fence to enclose the communications facility. \n \n• A ground ring trenched in around the base of the ballast tower foundation at a depth of 36 \ninches. \n \n• Buried electrical service and fiber optic cables from the existing GCI-operated fiber \nshelter along the ice bridge to the new site. \n \nGCI would need temporary work areas along the north, east, and south of the long-term lease \narea for the placement of the tower, shelter, and fencing. The dimensions of the temporary work \nareas would be 10 feet x 20 feet on the northwest side of lease area, 10 feet x 44 feet on the \nnortheast side of lease area, and 10 feet x 30 feet on the southeast site of lease area (GCI 2015). \nGCI proposes to construct from June through July 2016. GCI would contract a construction crew \nof 3 to 4 workers to transport the material in two flatbed trucks on the Dalton Highway. The first \ntruck would carry the tower sections, ballast, and I-beams and the second truck would carry the \nradio equipment and shelter. The ballast foundation would be filled with approximately 4,000 \npounds of gravel from an existing (permitted) borrow pit to stabilize the I-beams. System turn-up \nand testing would occur after construction in the fall and winter of 2016. Construction workers \nwould be housed off-site at Coldfoot Camp (GCI 2015). \n \n \n\n--- END PAGE 3 ---\n\n--- START PAGE 4 ---\nColdfoot Cell Tower, F-97066 \n \nPage 5 \n \nDESCRIPTION OF ALTERNATIVES ANALYZED IN DETAIL \n \nNo Action Alternative \n \nUnder the No Action Alternative, BLM would not grant the lease. Currently there is no wireless \nvoice and data coverage in Coldfoot, and that would not change under the No Action Alternative.  \n \nALTERNATIVES CONSIDERED BUT NOT ANALYZED IN DETAIL \n \nGCI considered the collocation of its wireless facilities on the Summit Telephone tower located \nwithin the community of Coldfoot, Alaska. This alternative is not feasible at this time because an \nagreement could not be negotiated between GCI and Summit Telephone. \n \n3. AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT \n \nPROJECT AREA \n \nThe project area is within Sec. 16, T. 28 N., R. 12 W., Fairbanks Meridian, Alaska \n \nAccess/Realty \nThe site is accessible via the Dalton Highway and then an existing road to the Coldfoot airport.  \nThe proposed site is located on land managed by BLM and is vacant, but has been disturbed by \ngravel fill and an adjacent underground utility line. \nCultural Resources \nThe potential site area has been previously disturbed by gravel fill and an adjacent underground \nutility line. No previously identified cultural resources are present within the direct area of \npotential effect (APE). The Coldfoot Historic District (WIS-00040) and Dalton Highway \n(WIS-00408) are within a half-mile visual APE.  \n \nFire Management \nThe project location is within a Full Management Option fire management unit (Alaska \nInteragency Coordination Center 2015). Objectives for this management option include \ncontrolling all wildland fires at the smallest acreage reasonably possible by initial response \nforces without compromising firefighter safety and providing appropriate protection to identified \nuninhabited structures and property (BLM 2005). \n\n--- END PAGE 4 ---\n\n--- START PAGE 5 ---\nColdfoot Cell Tower, F-97066 \n \nPage 6 \n \nHazardous Waste \nThe FCC requires eight (8) hours of back-up power be available for wireless site deployments. \nThe typical standby power backup for wireless sites is usually accomplished by batteries.  GCI \nFacilities Engineering has specified the use of 16 valve-regulated, non-spillable lead acid \nbatteries (Telcordia TEL 12-210 FG). \n \nInvasive, Non-native Plant Species \nInvasive plants are non-native aggressive plants with the potential to cause substantial damage to \nnative ecosystems and/or cause substantial economic losses. Over two dozen invasive plants \nhave been recorded in numerous infestations along the Dalton Highway (BLM 2013). According \nto available data, 15 invasive plant species occur in Coldfoot, AK (AKEPIC 2015). The Alaska \nNatural Heritage Program ranks plant invasiveness on a scale from 0 to 100 (100 being the most \ninvasive). Three of the most notable invasive species documented in Coldfoot, Alaska are oxeye \ndaisy (Leucanthemum vulgare), white sweetclover (Melilotus albus), and bird vetch (Vicia \ncracca). They have invasiveness scores of 61, 80, and 73, respectively (AKEPIC 2015). All three \nspecies are considered highly invasive and are identified for eradication in the Dalton \nManagement Area Integrated Invasive Plant Strategic Plan (BLM 2013). \n \nRecreation \nThe proposed project site is near the Dalton Highway which is popular with tour groups and \nindividuals for sightseeing and for accessing recreational hunting, fishing, gold panning, hiking, \ncamping, wildlife viewing, and rafting opportunities (BLM 1989, 2014). The project site is \nlocated near the Arctic Interagency Visitor Center in Coldfoot, Alaska. \n \nSocioeconomics \nThe tower would be located near the Dalton Highway, and currently there is no existing wireless \nvoice and data coverage.  \n \nThe community of Coldfoot was founded as a mining community, but was abandoned in 1912. \nThe current population is 10, and most residents are non-native.  Fifty-nine percent of residents \nare employed, but there are no unemployment insurance claimants.  \n \nSoils \nThe soil at the proposed project site has been previously disturbed. \n \nSubsistence \nSubsistence is an important part of livelihood and culture, especially in rural Alaska. The Dalton \nHighway provides access to some subsistence resources such as caribou and some fish species. \nSubsistence resources are harvested in the Coldfoot area by residents and neighboring villages, \nbut the proposed project site is not identified as a valuable subsistence use location.  \n \nVegetative Resources \nThe project site has been previously disturbed by gravel fill and an adjacent underground utility \nline. The structure would sit above the ground on an I-beam platform. Vegetation clearing is not \nrequired for this project. \n\n--- END PAGE 5 ---\n\n--- START PAGE 6 ---\nColdfoot Cell Tower, F-97066 \n \nPage 7 \n \nVisual Resources \nThe project location is within the Koyukuk Drainages Scenic Quality Unit described in the \nEnvironmental Impact Statement for the Utility Corridor Resource Management Plan. The area \nis characterized by little visual variety and is not visually unique. The unit has been given a \nrating of Scenic Quality Class B, which is given to areas that, though pleasing to the eye, tend to \nbe common throughout a landscape (BLM 1989). \n \nThe site has been previously disturbed by gravel fill and an adjacent underground utility line. \nThe Coldfoot Historic District (WIS-00040) and Dalton Highway (WIS-00408) are within a half-\nmile visual area of potential effect. \n \nWater Quality – Surface and Ground \nThe project area is permeable to precipitation and is not adjacent to waterbodies. \n \nWildlife \nThe Coldfoot area supports a variety of mammal species including brown and black bear (Ursus \narctos, U. americanus), wolf (Canis lupus), moose (Alces americanus), caribou (Rangifer \ntarandus), lynx (Lynx canadensis), wolverine (Gulo gulo), and red fox (Vulpes vulpes). A \nmultitude of bird species from seasonal migrants to year-round residents can also be found in the \narea, though there are no bird concentration areas near the proposed project site. \n \nRESOURCES CONSIDERED BUT DISMISSED FROM FURTHER CONSIDERATION \n \nAir Quality \nThe cellular communication site would draw from an existing power source in Coldfoot. No \nbackup generator would be required; therefore, there would be no new point source for \nemissions. The proposed action would have no adverse effect on air quality during operation. \n \nAreas of Critical Environmental Concern \n \nThe facility would not be located within any designated Areas of Critical Environmental \nConcern (BLM 2011). \n \nEnvironmental Justice \nThe population of Coldfoot is 10 (DCCED 2015). There are no minority and low-income \npopulations in the project area. Coldfoot is a highway outpost where workers live temporarily. \nTherefore, there would be no disproportionate impact to minority or low-income populations. \n \nEssential Fish Habitat \nThere is no Essential Fish Habitat within the project area. \n \nFarmlands, Prime and Unique \nThere are no prime or unique farmlands and no farmland/soil of local importance in the project \narea. \n \n\n--- END PAGE 6 ---\n\n--- START PAGE 7 ---\nColdfoot Cell Tower, F-97066 \n \nPage 8 \n \nFloodplains \nThe Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has not completed a study to determine \nflood hazard for the project location. According to the most recent flood and erosion hazard \ninformation available from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, there is no known flooding in \nColdfoot, Alaska (USACE 2011). \n \nThreatened or Endangered Species \nThe project location is not within the range of any proposed, candidate, threatened, or \nendangered species protected under the Endangered Species Act. \n \nWetlands/Riparian Zones \nThe project area has been mapped by the National Wetlands Inventory. No wetlands are present \nwithin the facility footprint (USFWS 2015). \n \nWild and Scenic Rivers \nNo Wild and Scenic Rivers are located in the project area. \n \nWilderness \nThe proposed facility location is not within a designated wilderness area. The proposed site is \nadjacent to existing developments and does not have wilderness characteristics. \n \n4. ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS \n \nDIRECT, INDIRECT, AND CUMULATIVE EFFECTS OF THE NO ACTION ALTERNATIVE \n \nUnder the No Action Alternative, the Coldfoot Wireless facility would not be developed and \nthere would be no impacts to access/realty, air quality, Areas of Environmental Concern, cultural \nresources, environmental justice, Essential Fish Habitat, farmlands, fire management, hazardous \nwaste, invasive species, mineral resources, Native American religious concerns, recreation, soils, \nsubsistence, threatened and endangered species, vegetation, visual resources, water quality, \nwetlands, Wild and Scenic Rivers, and wilderness areas. There would be no contribution to \ncumulative effects on these resources. \n \nDIRECT AND INDIRECT EFFECTS OF THE PROPOSED ACTION \n \nAccess/Realty \nThe proposed action would have no adverse effect on access and realty because the proposal \ndoes not include new roads, changes to ownership, or differ from the proposed future land use \n(BLM 1989). The project would provide additional revenue to BLM. \n \nCultural Resources \nThe proposed communication tower would be built in a previously disturbed area. There would \nbe no effect to previously identified historic properties in the direct APE. \n  \n\n--- END PAGE 7 ---\n\n--- START PAGE 8 ---\nColdfoot Cell Tower, F-97066 \n \nPage 9 \n \nThe proposed communication tower is expected to be visible from the Coldfoot Town Site \n(WIS-007), Coldfoot Mining Site (WIS-041), and Dalton Highway, but due to the associated \nsetting and characteristics, the potential tower would have no adverse effect to these resources.  \n \nFire Management \nHuman activity increases anthropogenic wildfire ignition. The proposal would not increase the \nrisk of fire beyond normal risk associated with human activity and construction projects. The \nproposed activity’s environmental effect on fire management would be minimal. \n \nHazardous Waste \nThe risk of a hazardous material spill from valve-regulated, non-spillable lead acid batteries is \nvery low and the effects would be localized. \n \nInvasive, Non-native Plant Species \nGround disturbance at the facility location and use of building materials and heavy equipment \nfrom developed areas can increase the risk of introducing invasive species. The most common \ninvasive plants in this region readily colonize disturbed substrate. The colonization and spread of \ninvasive species has a negative impact on native plant and wildlife communities.  \n \nThe most likely source of invasive species to the project area would be the spread of invasive \nspecies already identified in the area and the transport of new species via vehicles working in the \narea. It would not be possible to pinpoint whether the activities associated with the tower \nconstruction were source of introduction. \n \nEarly detection and rapid response to invasive species would help control and quickly address \npotential damage to a site if an invasive species becomes established. GCI would remove \ninvasive species if they are identified by BLM on the lease area. \n \nRecreation \nThe project site is adjacent to an existing developed site in Coldfoot, away from hunting, fishing, \nand mining opportunities as well as backcountry locations desired by backpackers and hikers. \nThe proposed action would have no adverse effect on recreation. The increased availability of \nwireless data and cellular service would improve the safety of recreationists in the area. \n \nSocioeconomics \nDuring construction, there would be temporary beneficial impact to businesses in Coldfoot for \nlodging and meals for the construction workers. The tower would have a beneficial impact on the \nsafety of the residents of Coldfoot and those travelling along the Dalton Highway, although \nlong-term socioeconomic impacts would be negligible. \n \nSoils \nThere is ground disturbance associated with leveling the ground in preparation for the \nnon-ground penetrating I-beam foundation and the installation of a ground ring and fiber optic \nand power cables. The proposed tower would sit above the surface of the ground. There would  \n \n \n\n--- END PAGE 8 ---\n\n--- START PAGE 9 ---\nColdfoot Cell Tower, F-97066 \n \nPage 10 \n \nbe heat-generating equipment in the shelter, but there would be fans to dissipate the heat for \ncontinued operation of the electronics. The adverse effects to soil, permafrost, and soil stability \nwould be minimal. \n \nSubsistence \nThe proposed project would not be located in a valuable subsistence harvest area and would have \nno adverse effect on subsistence. \n \nVegetative Resources \nAlthough vegetation clearing is not required for the project, there could be minimal impact to \nvegetative resources from the minimal soil disturbance. There could also be negligible effects on \nsun-loving vegetation if the structure creates heavily shaded areas. \n \nVisual Resources \nThe proposed site is adjacent to an existing developed site. The Coldfoot Historic District \n(WIS-00040) and Dalton Highway (WIS-00408) are within a half-mile visual area of potential \neffect. The communication tower is expected to be visible from the Coldfoot Town Site (WIS-\n007), Coldfoot Mining Site (WIS-041), and Dalton Highway, but due to the associated setting \nand characteristics, the potential tower would not likely cause an adverse effect to these \nresources. \n \nWater Quality – Surface and Ground \nThe project would not require the use of groundwater and the footprint of the tower would \nremain permeable. The footprint of the tower would not impact surface water because it would \nnot cause additional runoff. The proposed facility footprint would have no direct impact to water \nbodies. \n \nWildlife \nThe proposed project would be located on previously disturbed land near existing human \ndevelopments including a large utility corridor, roads, and an airstrip. The proposed project \nwould occupy a small amount of space in a location that is not considered high-quality habitat \nfor wildlife. The proposed tower would slightly increase the risk of avian collisions but the injury \nor mortality rate would not be high enough to affect populations. The proposed action would not \nadversely affect wildlife. \n \nCUMULATIVE EFFECTS UNDER THE PROPOSED ACTION \n \nClimate change has the potential to interact with and even exacerbate the impacts associated with \nthis project including impacts to visual resources and consequences of invasive species \nintroduction. Climate change may favor invasive plants if the amount and seasonal distribution \nof precipitation and seasonal temperature patterns shift in a manner conducive to invasive plant \ngrowth. If invasive plants are able to successfully move into areas not affected by human \ndisturbances, invasive plants could alter the plant composition of ecosystems and change their \nstructure and function over large landscape areas. This encroachment on native plant \ncommunities may happen more rapidly in the Arctic and Subarctic regions where climate change \nappears to happening at an accelerated rate compared to other regions.

It is possible that changes in landscape character attributes, including form, line, color, and \ntexture of vegetation, snowpack, and water, could increase visual contrast of the proposed \nstructure. \n \n5.

West ½ of the Southeast ¼ of Section 11, Township 26 South, Range 5 West, \nWillamette Meridian. \n \nDETERMINATION OF NEPA ADEQUACY (DNA):  Not all decisions require the use of a DNA.  \nWhen used, a DNA confirms that an action is adequately analyzed in existing NEPA document(s) and is \nin conformance with the land use plan.  The DNA worksheet is not itself a NEPA document.  The signed \nconclusion in the DNA worksheet is an interim step in the BLM’s internal review process and does not \nconstitute an appealable decision. \n \nA. Description of the Proposed Action \n \nThe BLM would further develop the trailhead parking area at the West Entrance to the North Bank \nHabitat Management Area (NBHMA).  These developments would include: installation of a single vault \ntoilet with a sealed vault, removal and replacement of the existing information kiosk, alteration of the \nexisting footprint to make more efficient use of the space available through identification of parking \nspaces and ADA parking spaces, construction of ADA compliant outdoor access routes to the restroom \nand kiosk, construction of an access trail just outside of the trailhead to link the two trails served by the \ntrailhead, planting of native vegetation, installation of perimeter fencing and interior fencing, installation \nof an entrance arbor and site ID sign, and removal and relocation of three hitching posts for equestrian \nuse. \n \nProject Design Features \n \n• \nEquipment would be pressure washed prior to project-related activities to reduce the spread of \nnoxious weed seed in accordance with direction in BLM Manual 9015- Integrated Weed \nManagement.  If equipment is removed from the project area, re-cleaning and inspection would \nbe required prior to re-entry onto BLM-administered lands. \n• \nConstruction would be restricted during the wet season, typically October 15 through May 15.  \nThe wet season restriction period may be adjusted in the event of unseasonably wet weather and \nsoil moisture conditions. \n \n \n \n\n--- END PAGE 0 ---\n\n--- START PAGE 1 ---\n2 \n \nB. Land Use Plan (LUP) Conformance \n \n2001 Roseburg District North Bank Habitat Management Area/ACEC Habitat Management Plan \nand Monitoring Plan. \n \nThe proposed action complies with the 2001 ROD/Habitat Management Plan and Monitoring Plan \nbecause it is specifically provided for in the following decision: \n \no Issue 2. Recreational Use and Facility Development/Objective #5 Provide a range of recreational \nopportunities compatible with the management of CWTD and other Special Status Species.        \n(p. 31) \no Management Actions/West Entrance Development. The development would take place on \napproximately 1.5 acres. A single vault toilet would be established to meet public needs and \nconfine wastes.  The vault toilet would be sealed to prevent water contamination by leaching. (p. \n32) \no Description of Alternative C (preferred alternative) North Bank Habitat Management Area/ACEC \n(p. 14).  Recreational use would be accommodated through the development of new facilities \n(West Entrance, and Doc’s Landing).  Parking areas would be constructed to increase \naccessibility and decrease safety hazards to users while loading and unloading vehicles and horse \ntrailers. \n \nC. Identify applicable National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) documents and other related \ndocuments that cover the proposed action. \n \n2001 North Bank Habitat Management Area/ACEC Environmental Impact Statement \n \nArchitectural Barriers Act of 1968 – Chapter 10 – Recreation Facilities \n \nD. NEPA Adequacy Criteria \n \n1. Is the new proposed action a feature of, or essentially similar to, an alternative analyzed in the \nexisting NEPA document(s)? Is the project within the same analysis area, or if the project location \nis different, are the geographic and resource conditions sufficiently similar to those analyzed in the \nexisting NEPA document(s)? If there are differences, can you explain why they are not substantial? \n \nThere are no differences in project location, or geographic and resource conditions that would render the \nexisting analysis insufficient.  The proposed action contains features of the selected alternative analyzed \nin the NEPA document.  This included development of the West Entrance and installation of a single \nvault toilet.  The proposed action would alter the footprint of the existing staging area, however this \nwould occur within the 1.5 acres identified as the project area in the selected alternative. \n \n2. Is the range of alternatives analyzed in the existing NEPA document(s) appropriate with respect \nto the new proposed action, given current environmental concerns, interests, and resource values? \n \nThe alternatives considered in the North Bank Habitat Management Area/ACEC EIS (pp. 13-16) \nconsisted of three alternatives; a No Action Alternative A, Alternative B, and the preferred Alternative C.  \nNothing, with respect to new information suggests that the range of alternatives were not sufficient to \naddress environmental concerns, public interest, and resource values. \n \n\n--- END PAGE 1 ---\n\n--- START PAGE 2 ---\n3 \n \nAlternative C described the accommodation of recreational use through development of new facilities, \nnamely the West Entrance and Doc’s Landing, to include the construction of parking areas to increase \naccessibility and decrease safety hazards. \n \nPublic interest and use in the area continues to increase and the proposed action is certainly relevant with \nrespect for the need to manage recreational impacts and provide for public use.  The project would \nprovide for public health and safety, manage parking, address accessibility requirements, and provide a \nfacility to manage increased visitation. \n \n3. Is the existing analysis valid in light of any new information or circumstances (such as, rangeland \nhealth standard assessment, recent endangered species listings, and updated lists of BLM-sensitive \nspecies)? Can you reasonably conclude that new information and new circumstances would not \nsubstantially change the analysis of the new proposed action? \n \nNo new information that would change the analysis with regard to the proposed action has been \nidentified. \n \n4. Are the direct, indirect, and cumulative effects that would result from implementation of the new \nproposed action similar (both quantitatively and qualitatively) to those analyzed in the existing \nNEPA document? \n \nCultural Resources \n \nBureau of Land Management personnel conducted cultural resource surveys on July 8, 2016 (CRS \nSW1611) in accordance with Appendix A of the 2015 protocol with the State of Oregon.  No new cultural \nresources were identified during this recent survey and there are no previously identified sites in the \nproject area.  This project would result in no effect to cultural properties.  The BLM has completed its \nSection 106 responsibilities under the 2012 National Programmatic Agreement and the 2015 OR \nSHPO/OR BLM Protocol.  If any cultural resources are identified during project implementation, work \nwould cease in that area and a BLM archaeologist would be notified. \n \nWildlife \n \nDirect, indirect and cumulative effects to the Columbian white-tailed deer and other sensitive \nspecies are unchanged from those analyzed in the North Bank HMA EIS. \n \nBotany \n \nThere are no Sensitive plants in the proposed project area, therefore there are no direct, indirect or no \ncumulative effects to Sensitive plant species. \n \nNoxious Weeds \n \nNoxious weeds would be treated prior to ground disturbing activities.  Project design features \nwould be followed to reduce the risk of invasion.  The project area would be monitored and \ntreated as one of the Roseburg District 2016-2017 weed treatment areas.  Cleaning equipment \nprior to entry onto BLM-administered lands would be required. \n \n \n \n\n--- END PAGE 2 ---\n\n--- START PAGE 3 ---\n4 \n \nSoils \n \nThe North Bank Habitat Management Area/ACEC FEIS analyzed the direct, indirect, and cumulative \neffects of recreation facility development on soil productivity, including expanding the West Entrance \nfrom 0.5 to 1.5 acres as described in the new proposed action.  Short term erosion would be minor \nbecause construction would be limited to the dry season.  The new disturbance would permanently \nremove 1 acre from the productive land base (less than 0.02 percent of NBHMA). \n \n5. Are the public involvement and interagency review associated with existing NEPA document(s) \nadequate for the current proposed action? \n \nA mailing list was compiled consisting of individuals and organizations that requested or were sent a \ncopy of Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS).  Each person or organization that attended a \nNorth Bank Habitat Management Area (NBHMA) open house or, submitted substantive written \ncomments was also included on the mailing list. \n \nThere was a sixty day public comment period for the DEIS from December 28, 1999 through February \n28, 1999, and the comment period was extended an additional 15 days until March 13 2000. \n \nThe Roseburg District received 28 letters with 124 specific comments from individuals, government \nofficials, and organizations.  A thirty day public review period was established on September 22, 2000 \nand subsequently extended and additional fifteen days until November 6, 2000. \n \nPublic involvement in the planning process for the NBHMA/ACEC was extensive and did have \nsignificant influence on the development of the ROD, the HMP and the Monitoring Plan \n \nAdditional comments more specific to the proposed development of the West Entrance Trailhead were \nobtained at two public meetings held in May of 2016.

However, research to date on NEPA has been hindered by federal agency data management practices: NEPA documents are scattered across numerous agency databases, often in machine-unreadable formats, and typically lack basic metadata and other identifiers. As such, researchers have had to craft bespoke subsets of NEPA data from which to glean insights—a time-consuming task that has limited the information available about NEPA’s effectiveness and paved the way for a national permitting reform conversation rife with anecdotes and cherry-picked information.\nThe newly released National Environmental Policy Act Text Corpus (NEPATEC) 2.0 dataset from the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory’s (PNNL’s) PermitAI project has the potential to add new, more comprehensive evidence into this conversation. PNNL has built and released a comprehensive dataset of past environmental reviews and permitting documents containing millions of pages and billions of words in machine-readable JSON format. The database contains more than 120,000 NEPA documents1 (categorical exclusions, draft and final environmental assessments, draft and final environmental impact statements, records of decision, findings of no significant impact, and other supporting documentation) from 60,000 projects prepared by more than 60 different agencies. Each document contains metadata for (as applicable):\n• Lead agency\n• Category\n• Type of review\n• Name of project\n• Location\n• Project sponsor\n• Project sector\n• Project type (a subset of project sector)\n• Type of document\n• Document title\n• Agency or contractor responsible for preparing the document\n• Categorical exclusion category \n• Summary of the proposed action\nThe National Environmental Policy Act Text Corpus (NEPATEC) 2.0 can be accessed here on huggingface.\n\n\n\nThis shows the original data sctuture of the projecet in it’s original json format.

All of the variables for all the tables of deliverable 1 are in the metadata.\nThe wrinkle here is that many projects have mutiple tags. For example, the project named as “Coldfoot Cell Tower” in the “project_title” variable has two values for project_type: [‘Utilities (electricity, gas, telecommunications)’ ‘Broadband’]. While “Utilities (electricity, gas, telecommunications)” is a Clean Energy category, “Broadband” is not. So, I’ll need to either remove the Clean Energy flag by stripping all of those unique combinations of “Utilities” and “Broadband”. For now, I want to mark it for consideration by creating a new varible flag, call it energy_type_questions. Another example has a clearer solution. The project titled “Install Oil Field Facilities and Equipment on Little 6 Tank Facility Sec 6D” in the project_type variable has the following values: ““[‘Conventional Energy Production - Land-based Oil & Gas’ ‘Utilities (electricity, gas, telecommunications)’]”. The issue here is that although it has utilities (includes gas and electric) that is a clean energy tag, it also has the fossil fuel tag of “conventional energy production - land-based oil & gas’ tag. Any clean energy tag that also has a fossil fuel tag should be classifed as fossil fuel. So, I’ll need some code to ensure any clean energy flagged project that has any fossil fuel tag is ultimately tagged as fossil fuel. Finally, I want another variable that is simply a count of the number of unique values for project_type *(call it project_type_count), another that counts the unique clean energy tags (call it project_type_count_clean), and finally one that counts unique fossil fuel tags (call it project_type_count_fossil).\n\n\nThis table will group the three datasets together (ER, ES, and CE) and create counts by technology. I will have to filter out all non-clean-energy variables to complete this deliverable. No other new variables will be necessary to be created since project_type is in the metadata and will serve as the “technology” variable. Will need to concatenate the three datasets together to make the count.\nList of all necessary variables (include those that need to be created):\n\nproject_type\nproject_energy_type\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTechnology\nEnvironmental Review\nEnvironmental Statement\nCategorical Exclusion\n\n\n\n\nOffshore wind\nXXX\nXXX\nXXX\n\n\nOnshore wind\nXXX\nXXX\nXXX\n\n\nSolar\nXXX\nXXX\nXXX\n\n\nGeothermal\nXXX\nXXX\nXXX\n\n\netc.\nXXX\nXXX\nXXX\n\n\nTotal\nXX,XXX\nXX,XXX\nXX,XXX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis table will group the three datasets together (ER, ES, and CE) and create counts by agency.

I will have to filter out all non-clean-energy variables to complete this deliverable. From th project_location, we’ll need to create a project_state and a project_county variable, which can be easilly created from project_location variable with some regex or geo locating the (lat-long) coordinates. Which do you suggest? The wrinkle here is that the values for project_location are not clean or consistent and will need some extra work to create a county or state-level, if even possible.

The “energy type” variable will need to be created from the project_type variable where the values on this variable match the list of of Clean and Fossil Energy tags in ea_project_type.txt. Note that all other types not listed in either “Clean” or “Fossil” will be classified as “Other” since we want each project to be counted in the table.\nCreating the project_energy_type will be necessary (as described above) to completing this delieverable.\nList of all necessary variables (include those that need to be created):\n\nproject_type\nproject_energy_type #\nproject_energy_type_questions\nproject_type_count\nproject_type_count_clean\nproject_type_count_fossil\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnergy Type\nEnvironmental Review\nEnvironmental Statement\nCategorical Exclusion\n\n\n\n\nClean Energy\nXXX\nXXX\nXXX\n\n\nFossil Fuel\nXXX\nXXX\nXXX\n\n\nOther\nXXX\nXXX\nXXX\n\n\nTotal\nXX,XXX\nXX,XXX\nXX,XXX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis table will group the three datasets together (ER, ES, and CE) and create counts by generation capacity. The “generation capacity” variable will need to be created from reading all the documents for each project, searching for specify mentions of the amount of projected energy generation capacity for each project. I guess there are two ways to do this: (1) specify all the possible ways a project might specify genration capacity and use python’s set to see if any of the documents associated with that project contain any estimates, keeping mind that I want the values, not just the type of energy capacity (e.g., MW, kW, etc.) or (2) feed all of the text documents associated with a project (there will be many tens to thousands per project) into an LLM to read it pull out the generation capcity it discusses. I’m not sure which approach is best. The pro is that each page is already in a text format in the page_text variable. So either process will just have to group by project_id. Which every process I use, I want two new variables, one is the unit of measure (e.g., MW, kW, etc.) (call it project_gencap_measure) while the other is the value of the generation capacity (call it project_gencap_value). After I have these variables, I can figure out a way to classify the energy capacity into low-med-high catogories (which might require talking to the project funders).\nList of all necessary variables (include those that need to be created):\n\nproject_id\npage_text\nproject_gencap_measure\nproject_gencap_value\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnergy Generation Capacity\nEnvironmental Review\nEnvironmental Statement\nCategorical Exclusion\n\n\n\n\nHigh\nXXX\nXXX\nXXX\n\n\nMedium\nXXX\nXXX\nXXX\n\n\nLow\nXXX\nXXX\nXXX\n\n\nTotal\nXX,XXX\nXX,XXX\nXX,XXX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis table will group the three datasets together (ER, ES, and CE) and create counts by time. The “time” variable will need to be created and I’m not sure how to do that. This is probably the hardest variable since I think I need to read all of the documents associated with a project and constructure a timeline for each project as it moves through the NEPA process. While a project in the CE dataset will not be in the other datset, a project in ER could move to ES, which is the more intensive review process. So, I’ll likely need to check which projects are in both and read all of those documents to create a timeline variable. I’m also not sure how best to organize this varible, is it one variable as a list, a vector, etc.? It’d be great to create the table below a number of different ways, by year, by time it took, and then have a variable for the number of days a project was under review so I can create a data visualization using days by project status.\nList of all necessary variables (include those that need to be created):\n\nproject_id\npage_text\ntimeline? - I’m not sure what is best here and need suggestions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYear\nEnvironmental Review\nEnvironmental Statement\nCategorical Exclusion\n\n\n\n\n2025\nXXX\nXXX\nXXX\n\n\n2024\nXXX\nXXX\nXXX\n\n\n2023\nXXX\nXXX\nXXX\n\n\nTotal\nXX,XXX\nXX,XXX\nXX,XXX\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere are some rules and procedures to follow throughout this project.\n\n\nEnsure where possible that the name of any newly created variables include a prefix in the variable name indicating the level they are. All variables at the “document” level begin with document_[varname], “project” level begin with project_[varname], etc. The universe of possible prefixes include: “project”, “process”, “documents”, “pages”. Most new variables will likely be at the “project stage since that is my level of observation for most things in this project."

    "text": "Federal environmental permitting—and, relatedly, the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA)—has often been blamed as a core contributor to delays in infrastructure deployment. However, research to date on NEPA has been hindered by federal agency data management practices: NEPA documents are scattered across numerous agency databases, often in machine-unreadable formats, and typically lack basic metadata and other identifiers. As such, researchers have had to craft bespoke subsets of NEPA data from which to glean insights—a time-consuming task that has limited the information available about NEPA’s effectiveness and paved the way for a national permitting reform conversation rife with anecdotes and cherry-picked information.\nThe newly released National Environmental Policy Act Text Corpus (NEPATEC) 2.0 dataset from the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory’s (PNNL’s) PermitAI project has the potential to add new, more comprehensive evidence into this conversation. PNNL has built and released a comprehensive dataset of past environmental reviews and permitting documents containing millions of pages and billions of words in machine-readable JSON format. The database contains more than 120,000 NEPA documents1 (categorical exclusions, draft and final environmental assessments, draft and final environmental impact statements, records of decision, findings of no significant impact, and other supporting documentation) from 60,000 projects prepared by more than 60 different agencies. Each document contains metadata for (as applicable):\n• Lead agency\n• Category\n• Type of review\n• Name of project\n• Location\n• Project sponsor\n• Project sector\n• Project type (a subset of project sector)\n• Type of document\n• Document title\n• Agency or contractor responsible for preparing the document\n• Categorical exclusion category \n• Summary of the proposed action\nThe National Environmental Policy Act Text Corpus (NEPATEC) 2.0 can be accessed here on huggingface."

I will have to filter out all non-clean-energy variables to complete this deliverable. From th project_location, we’ll need to create a project_state and a project_county variable, which can be easilly created from project_location variable with some regex or geo locating the (lat-long) coordinates. Which do you suggest? The wrinkle here is that the values for project_location are not clean or consistent and will need some extra work to create a county or state-level, if even possible.

The “energy type” variable will need to be created from the project_type variable where the values on this variable match the list of of Clean and Fossil Energy tags in ea_project_type.txt. Note that all other types not listed in either “Clean” or “Fossil” will be classified as “Other” since we want each project to be counted in the table.\nCreating the project_energy_type will be necessary (as described above) to completing this delieverable.\nList of all necessary variables (include those that need to be created):\n\nproject_type\nproject_energy_type #\nproject_energy_type_questions\nproject_type_count\nproject_type_count_clean\nproject_type_count_fossil\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnergy Type\nEnvironmental Review\nEnvironmental Statement\nCategorical Exclusion\n\n\n\n\nClean Energy\nXXX\nXXX\nXXX\n\n\nFossil Fuel\nXXX\nXXX\nXXX\n\n\nOther\nXXX\nXXX\nXXX\n\n\nTotal\nXX,XXX\nXX,XXX\nXX,XXX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis table will group the three datasets together (ER, ES, and CE) and create counts by generation capacity. The “generation capacity” variable will need to be created from reading all the documents for each project, searching for specify mentions of the amount of projected energy generation capacity for each project. I guess there are two ways to do this: (1) specify all the possible ways a project might specify genration capacity and use python’s set to see if any of the documents associated with that project contain any estimates, keeping mind that I want the values, not just the type of energy capacity (e.g., MW, kW, etc.) or (2) feed all of the text documents associated with a project (there will be many tens to thousands per project) into an LLM to read it pull out the generation capcity it discusses. I’m not sure which approach is best. The pro is that each page is already in a text format in the page_text variable. So either process will just have to group by project_id. Which every process I use, I want two new variables, one is the unit of measure (e.g., MW, kW, etc.) (call it project_gencap_measure) while the other is the value of the generation capacity (call it project_gencap_value). After I have these variables, I can figure out a way to classify the energy capacity into low-med-high catogories (which might require talking to the project funders).\nList of all necessary variables (include those that need to be created):\n\nproject_id\npage_text\nproject_gencap_measure\nproject_gencap_value\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnergy Generation Capacity\nEnvironmental Review\nEnvironmental Statement\nCategorical Exclusion\n\n\n\n\nHigh\nXXX\nXXX\nXXX\n\n\nMedium\nXXX\nXXX\nXXX\n\n\nLow\nXXX\nXXX\nXXX\n\n\nTotal\nXX,XXX\nXX,XXX\nXX,XXX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis table will group the three datasets together (ER, ES, and CE) and create counts by time. The “time” variable will need to be created and I’m not sure how to do that. This is probably the hardest variable since I think I need to read all of the documents associated with a project and constructure a timeline for each project as it moves through the NEPA process. While a project in the CE dataset will not be in the other datset, a project in ER could move to ES, which is the more intensive review process. So, I’ll likely need to check which projects are in both and read all of those documents to create a timeline variable. I’m also not sure how best to organize this varible, is it one variable as a list, a vector, etc.? It’d be great to create the table below a number of different ways, by year, by time it took, and then have a variable for the number of days a project was under review so I can create a data visualization using days by project status.\nList of all necessary variables (include those that need to be created):\n\nproject_id\npage_text\ntimeline? - I’m not sure what is best here and need suggestions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYear\nEnvironmental Review\nEnvironmental Statement\nCategorical Exclusion\n\n\n\n\n2025\nXXX\nXXX\nXXX\n\n\n2024\nXXX\nXXX\nXXX\n\n\n2023\nXXX\nXXX\nXXX\n\n\nTotal\nXX,XXX\nXX,XXX\nXX,XXX"

    "text": "This document is a good reference for how to contextualize this project, the project goals and data, and to clearly understand the project deliverables and timeline.\n\n\nFederal environmental permitting—and, relatedly, the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA)—has often been blamed as a core contributor to delays in infrastructure deployment. However, research to date on NEPA has been hindered by federal agency data management practices: NEPA documents are scattered across numerous agency databases, often in machine-unreadable formats, and typically lack basic metadata and other identifiers. As such, researchers have had to craft bespoke subsets of NEPA data from which to glean insights—a time-consuming task that has limited the information available about NEPA’s effectiveness and paved the way for a national permitting reform conversation rife with anecdotes and cherry-picked information.\nThe newly released National Environmental Policy Act Text Corpus (NEPATEC) 2.0 dataset from the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory’s (PNNL’s) PermitAI project has the potential to add new, more comprehensive evidence into this conversation. PNNL has built and released a comprehensive dataset of past environmental reviews and permitting documents containing millions of pages and billions of words in machine-readable JSON format. The database contains more than 120,000 NEPA documents1 (categorical exclusions, draft and final environmental assessments, draft and final environmental impact statements, records of decision, findings of no significant impact, and other supporting documentation) from 60,000 projects prepared by more than 60 different agencies. Each document contains metadata for (as applicable):\n• Lead agency\n• Category\n• Type of review\n• Name of project\n• Location\n• Project sponsor\n• Project sector\n• Project type (a subset of project sector)\n• Type of document\n• Document title\n• Agency or contractor responsible for preparing the document\n• Categorical exclusion category \n• Summary of the proposed action\nThe National Environmental Policy Act Text Corpus (NEPATEC) 2.0 can be accessed here on huggingface.\n\n\n\nThis shows the original data sctuture of the projecet in it’s original json format.

whether projects are multi-state or multi-agency\nNumber of pages over time, including pre- and post- Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 (FRA), which set page limit requirements\nTechnology-specific inquiries\n\nTransmission lines: length of lines from project summary correlated with timelines, location, etc.\nGeothermal: timelines of environmental reviews for different phases of the same project\nCarbon and hydrogen pipelines (if available): length of pipelines from project summary correlated with timelines, location, etc.; compare to natural gas pipelines\n\n\n\n\n\nPhase 2 of the project is still not settled and we’ll need to scope it based on what we find and do in Phase 1.

All of the variables for all the tables of deliverable 1 are in the metadata.\nThe wrinkle here is that many projects have mutiple tags. For example, the project named as “Coldfoot Cell Tower” in the “project_title” variable has two values for project_type: [‘Utilities (electricity, gas, telecommunications)’ ‘Broadband’]. While “Utilities (electricity, gas, telecommunications)” is a Clean Energy category, “Broadband” is not. So, I’ll need to either remove the Clean Energy flag by stripping all of those unique combinations of “Utilities” and “Broadband”. For now, I want to mark it for consideration by creating a new varible flag, call it energy_type_questions. Another example has a clearer solution. The project titled “Install Oil Field Facilities and Equipment on Little 6 Tank Facility Sec 6D” in the project_type variable has the following values: ““[‘Conventional Energy Production - Land-based Oil & Gas’ ‘Utilities (electricity, gas, telecommunications)’]”. The issue here is that although it has utilities (includes gas and electric) that is a clean energy tag, it also has the fossil fuel tag of “conventional energy production - land-based oil & gas’ tag. Any clean energy tag that also has a fossil fuel tag should be classifed as fossil fuel. So, I’ll need some code to ensure any clean energy flagged project that has any fossil fuel tag is ultimately tagged as fossil fuel. Finally, I want another variable that is simply a count of the number of unique values for project_type *(call it project_type_count), another that counts the unique clean energy tags (call it project_type_count_clean), and finally one that counts unique fossil fuel tags (call it project_type_count_fossil).\n\n\nThis table will group the three datasets together (ER, ES, and CE) and create counts by technology. I will have to filter out all non-clean-energy variables to complete this deliverable.

I’m not sure which approach is best. The pro is that each page is already in a text format in the page_text variable. So either process will just have to group by project_id. Which every process I use, I want two new variables, one is the unit of measure (e.g., MW, kW, etc.) (call it project_gencap_measure) while the other is the value of the generation capacity (call it project_gencap_value). After I have these variables, I can figure out a way to classify the energy capacity into low-med-high catogories (which might require talking to the project funders).\nList of all necessary variables (include those that need to be created):\n\nproject_id\npage_text\nproject_gencap_measure\nproject_gencap_value\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnergy Generation Capacity\nEnvironmental Review\nEnvironmental Statement\nCategorical Exclusion\n\n\n\n\nHigh\nXXX\nXXX\nXXX\n\n\nMedium\nXXX\nXXX\nXXX\n\n\nLow\nXXX\nXXX\nXXX\n\n\nTotal\nXX,XXX\nXX,XXX\nXX,XXX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis table will group the three datasets together (ER, ES, and CE) and create counts by time. The “time” variable will need to be created and I’m not sure how to do that. This is probably the hardest variable since I think I need to read all of the documents associated with a project and constructure a timeline for each project as it moves through the NEPA process. While a project in the CE dataset will not be in the other datset, a project in ER could move to ES, which is the more intensive review process. So, I’ll likely need to check which projects are in both and read all of those documents to create a timeline variable. I’m also not sure how best to organize this varible, is it one variable as a list, a vector, etc.? It’d be great to create the table below a number of different ways, by year, by time it took, and then have a variable for the number of days a project was under review so I can create a data visualization using days by project status.\nList of all necessary variables (include those that need to be created):\n\nproject_id\npage_text\ntimeline? - I’m not sure what is best here and need suggestions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYear\nEnvironmental Review\nEnvironmental Statement\nCategorical Exclusion\n\n\n\n\n2025\nXXX\nXXX\nXXX\n\n\n2024\nXXX\nXXX\nXXX\n\n\n2023\nXXX\nXXX\nXXX\n\n\nTotal\nXX,XXX\nXX,XXX\nXX,XXX\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere are some rules and procedures to follow throughout this project.\n\n\nEnsure where possible that the name of any newly created variables include a prefix in the variable name indicating the level they are. All variables at the “document” level begin with document_[varname], “project” level begin with project_[varname], etc. The universe of possible prefixes include: “project”, “process”, “documents”, “pages”. Most new variables will likely be at the “project stage since that is my level of observation for most things in this project."

    "text": "Federal environmental permitting—and, relatedly, the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA)—has often been blamed as a core contributor to delays in infrastructure deployment. However, research to date on NEPA has been hindered by federal agency data management practices: NEPA documents are scattered across numerous agency databases, often in machine-unreadable formats, and typically lack basic metadata and other identifiers. As such, researchers have had to craft bespoke subsets of NEPA data from which to glean insights—a time-consuming task that has limited the information available about NEPA’s effectiveness and paved the way for a national permitting reform conversation rife with anecdotes and cherry-picked information.\nThe newly released National Environmental Policy Act Text Corpus (NEPATEC) 2.0 dataset from the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory’s (PNNL’s) PermitAI project has the potential to add new, more comprehensive evidence into this conversation. PNNL has built and released a comprehensive dataset of past environmental reviews and permitting documents containing millions of pages and billions of words in machine-readable JSON format. The database contains more than 120,000 NEPA documents1 (categorical exclusions, draft and final environmental assessments, draft and final environmental impact statements, records of decision, findings of no significant impact, and other supporting documentation) from 60,000 projects prepared by more than 60 different agencies. Each document contains metadata for (as applicable):\n• Lead agency\n• Category\n• Type of review\n• Name of project\n• Location\n• Project sponsor\n• Project sector\n• Project type (a subset of project sector)\n• Type of document\n• Document title\n• Agency or contractor responsible for preparing the document\n• Categorical exclusion category \n• Summary of the proposed action\nThe National Environmental Policy Act Text Corpus (NEPATEC) 2.0 can be accessed here on huggingface."

    "text": "I evision making three tables to satisfy this deliverable. All of the variables for all the tables of deliverable 1 are in the metadata.\nThe wrinkle here is that many projects have mutiple tags. For example, the project named as “Coldfoot Cell Tower” in the “project_title” variable has two values for project_type: [‘Utilities (electricity, gas, telecommunications)’ ‘Broadband’]. While “Utilities (electricity, gas, telecommunications)” is a Clean Energy category, “Broadband” is not. So, I’ll need to either remove the Clean Energy flag by stripping all of those unique combinations of “Utilities” and “Broadband”. For now, I want to mark it for consideration by creating a new varible flag, call it energy_type_questions. Another example has a clearer solution. The project titled “Install Oil Field Facilities and Equipment on Little 6 Tank Facility Sec 6D” in the project_type variable has the following values: ““[‘Conventional Energy Production - Land-based Oil & Gas’ ‘Utilities (electricity, gas, telecommunications)’]”. The issue here is that although it has utilities (includes gas and electric) that is a clean energy tag, it also has the fossil fuel tag of “conventional energy production - land-based oil & gas’ tag. Any clean energy tag that also has a fossil fuel tag should be classifed as fossil fuel. So, I’ll need some code to ensure any clean energy flagged project that has any fossil fuel tag is ultimately tagged as fossil fuel. Finally, I want another variable that is simply a count of the number of unique values for project_type *(call it project_type_count), another that counts the unique clean energy tags (call it project_type_count_clean), and finally one that counts unique fossil fuel tags (call it project_type_count_fossil).\n\n\nThis table will group the three datasets together (ER, ES, and CE) and create counts by technology. I will have to filter out all non-clean-energy variables to complete this deliverable.

After I have these variables, I can figure out a way to classify the energy capacity into low-med-high catogories (which might require talking to the project funders).\nList of all necessary variables (include those that need to be created):\n\nproject_id\npage_text\nproject_gencap_measure\nproject_gencap_value\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnergy Generation Capacity\nEnvironmental Review\nEnvironmental Statement\nCategorical Exclusion\n\n\n\n\nHigh\nXXX\nXXX\nXXX\n\n\nMedium\nXXX\nXXX\nXXX\n\n\nLow\nXXX\nXXX\nXXX\n\n\nTotal\nXX,XXX\nXX,XXX\nXX,XXX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis table will group the three datasets together (ER, ES, and CE) and create counts by time. The “time” variable will need to be created and I’m not sure how to do that. This is probably the hardest variable since I think I need to read all of the documents associated with a project and constructure a timeline for each project as it moves through the NEPA process. While a project in the CE dataset will not be in the other datset, a project in ER could move to ES, which is the more intensive review process. So, I’ll likely need to check which projects are in both and read all of those documents to create a timeline variable. I’m also not sure how best to organize this varible, is it one variable as a list, a vector, etc.? It’d be great to create the table below a number of different ways, by year, by time it took, and then have a variable for the number of days a project was under review so I can create a data visualization using days by project status.\nList of all necessary variables (include those that need to be created):\n\nproject_id\npage_text\ntimeline? - I’m not sure what is best here and need suggestions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYear\nEnvironmental Review\nEnvironmental Statement\nCategorical Exclusion\n\n\n\n\n2025\nXXX\nXXX\nXXX\n\n\n2024\nXXX\nXXX\nXXX\n\n\n2023\nXXX\nXXX\nXXX\n\n\nTotal\nXX,XXX\nXX,XXX\nXX,XXX"
