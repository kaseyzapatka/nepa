## Executive Summary

::: {.callout-note}
## Key decisions to make for next steps:
-   [ ] Do we need to further refine "Other" since they seem rather large?

:::


This report aims to create the following set of deliverables: 

> Data on how many clean energy projects have been categorically excluded vs. have required environmental assessments and environmental impact statements.  Broken out by number of projects, generation capacity, and change over time.

# Energy Type Summary

For context, @tbl-energy-summary summarizes the breakdown of projects by energy type. I wonder the extent to which "Other" projects need to further refined.  

```{r}
#| label: tbl-energy-summary
#| tbl-cap: "Project counts by energy classification"

summary_stats <- read_csv(file.path(d3_tables, "energy_type_summary.csv"), show_col_types = FALSE)

summary_stats %>%
  mutate(Percent = sprintf("%.1f%%", Percent)) %>%
  kable(
    align = c("l", "r", "r"),
    format.args = list(big.mark = ",")
  ) %>%
  kable_styling(
    bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"),
    full_width = FALSE,
    position = "left"
  )

# Process Types by Energy Classification

::: {.callout-tip}
## Key Findings: Process Type
**Clean energy projects use Categorical Exclusions at higher rates** than fossil fuel or other types of projects. This could reflect smaller project footprints for clean energy projects?  Fossil fuel projects show higher EA/EIS rates, consistent with larger environmental footprints requiring more detailed review.
:::

@fig-energy-grouped visualizes project counts by review and energy type, whereas @fig-energy-composition reports the share of review process types within energy types.

# Timeline Analysis for Clean Energy (Preliminary)

::: {.callout-warning}
## Data Quality Notice
Timeline data is extracted using regex pattern and have some clear data quality issues that require further refinement before final analysis.
:::

**Data Quality Summary**

About 26% of clean energy projects don't have clean timeline data -- could be process-- and large chunk likely have errors.  

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Projects with dates extracted | 19,694 (74%) |
| Projects flagged for review | 15,289 (57%) |
| Duration >5 years (likely errors) | 6,116 (31%) |
| Duration >10 years (likely errors) | 4,694 (24%) |

: Timeline data quality metrics {#tbl-timeline-quality}

::: {.callout-tip}
## Key Findings: Technology
**CE projects have the shortest timelines,** whereas EA and EIS projects are less frequent and can have longer durations. There are likely some date extraction issue that are inflating review times. 
:::

Figure @fig-projects-by-year shows project counts over time, faceted by process type. CE projects dominate in volume with relatively consistent counts from 2010–2024, while EA and EIS projects are fewer and more variable year-to-year.


```{r}
#| label: fig-projects-by-year
#| fig-cap: "NEPA projects by year and process type (preliminary data)"
#| out-width: "100%"

knitr::include_graphics(file.path(d3_figures, "03_projects_by_year.png"))
```


Figure @fig-duration-boxplot compares project durations across process types: CE projects are typically very short (median ~0 days), whereas EA (~11.5 years) and EIS (~20 years) show unusually long durations, likely reflecting false positives from date extraction rather than actual review timelines.

```{r}
#| label: fig-duration-boxplot
#| fig-cap: "Project duration distribution by process type (preliminary data)"
#| out-width: "90%"

knitr::include_graphics(file.path(d3_figures, "03_duration_boxplot.png"))
```


**Next Steps for Timeline Extraction**

1. **Implement structure-aware preprocessing**: Remove reference/bibliography sections before date extraction to eliminate citation false positives

2. **Focus analysis on specific documents**: Create variable to idenify document type and only search the most useful, likely with an LLM. 

3. **Add QA-based extraction**: Use question-answering models to directly ask "When was the decision signed?" rather than extracting all dates and filtering

4. **Validate sample manually**: Review 50-100 flagged projects to assess extraction accuracy and identify systematic errors

5. **Filter for reliable data**: For final analysis, restrict to projects with duration <5 years and explicit decision dates found
