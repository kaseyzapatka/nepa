## Executive Summary

This report analyzes NEPA process types (CE, EA, EIS) across energy classifications.

::: {.callout-note}
## Data Scope
Analysis covers **26,000+ clean energy projects** extracted from the NEPA database, classified using energy technology tags (solar, wind, transmission, storage, geothermal, hydropower, nuclear, hydrogen, and efficiency/conservation).

# Process Types by Energy Classification

How do NEPA review processes differ across energy types (Clean, Fossil, Other)?

```{r}
#| label: fig-energy-grouped

#| out-width: "90%"

knitr::include_graphics(file.path(d3_figures, "01_energy_type_grouped.png"))
```

```{r}
#| label: fig-energy-composition

::: {.callout-tip}
## Key Finding: Process Type
**Clean energy projects use Categorical Exclusions at higher rates** than fossil fuel projects. This likely reflects:

1. Smaller project footprints (rooftop solar, efficiency upgrades)
2. DOE's programmatic CEs for loan guarantee activities
3. Routine transmission maintenance and upgrades

Fossil projects show higher EA/EIS rates, consistent with larger environmental footprints requiring more detailed review.
