# National Environmental Policy Act 

As the U.S. expands clean energy and modernizes its infrastructure, the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) plays a critical role. Recently, it has become a focal point in policy debates—often misunderstood, mischaracterized, and used as a proxy for larger political battles. While CATF has identified opportunities for efficiency and improvement in the environmental review process, NEPA can support rapid, responsible clean energy deployment while centering communities and the environment.


## What is NEPA? 

NEPA is a foundational environmental law that has, for more than fifty years, ensured that federal agencies consider the environmental impacts of a proposed major federal action. NEPA does not mandate particular outcomes or standards; instead, it requires federal agencies to consider the reasonably foreseeable environmental impacts of their activities, integrate those considerations into agency decision making, and enhance public transparency in the decision-making process. ​NEPA reviews are also often integrated with implementation of other bedrock statutes, such as the Endangered Species Act, Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, and National Historic Preservation Act. ​ 

## What is the NEPA process? 

The NEPA process is a mandatory decision-making process that requires federal agencies to consider the potential impacts of proposed “major federal actions” before committing resources. Major federal actions are those subject to an agency’s control and responsibility; for clean energy infrastructure projects, when NEPA is triggered, it is often because a project is located on or crosses federal or Tribal trust land or receives federal grants or loans. 

For example, if the federal government is considering whether to grant the right-of-way for a new transmission line to cross federal land, which will connect energy projects to the grid, NEPA requires the agency to evaluate how the project might affect local ecosystems, cultural resources, nearby communities, and other resource areas, and document that analysis in an environmental review. Although limited by recent agency changes, the public should then have an opportunity to review and comment on the agency’s analysis before a final decision is made. 


## NEPA FAQs

### Does NEPA cause project delays?

NEPA is often scapegoated as a core cause of infrastructure delays and cancellations. However, arguments that blame NEPA for permitting delays mischaracterize the empirical reality. Where projects are subject to NEPA, evidence shows that NEPA in fact improves environmental decision making and may actually improve overall permitting efficiency by providing a coordination mechanism among federal agencies. Indeed, most delays are the result of factors other than NEPA itself, such as lack of sufficient staffing, budget, and coordination at federal agencies; project-specific elements (e.g., supply chain constraints); and lack of alignment in state and local permitting requirements.  


### Which energy infrastructure projects are subject to NEPA?

Most solar and onshore wind projects in the United States are not subject to NEPA. One recent study found that less than five percent of onshore wind and solar projects constructed between 2010 and 2021 required a comprehensive environment review under NEPA or a project-specific permit under the Clean Water Act or Endangered Species Act.  
Because they are sited in federal waters, all offshore wind projects are subject to NEPA review. 
Geothermal projects are overwhelmingly located on federal land, which triggers a NEPA review, and indeed separate NEPA reviews may be required for each phase of development. 

Transmission lines sometimes cross federal lands or receive federal funding, with a resulting 26 percent of all new electric transmission line miles from 2010-2020 requiring an environmental impact statement. 

### Who implements NEPA?

NEPA established the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ), which oversees the law’s implementation across the government. Each individual federal agency, in consultation with CEQ, has the responsibility to develop its own NEPA procedures. Individual agencies are also responsible for conducting NEPA reviews. 

For more than 40 years, CEQ-issued NEPA regulations promoted consistency across the federal government. In early 2025, following an executive order, CEQ rescinded those regulations. Federal agencies soon followed suit, with many rescinding their existing NEPA regulations and replacing them with agency-specific nonbinding procedural guidance. For now, the NEPA landscape is that of a patchwork of differing implementing procedures across agencies. 


### How can the NEPA process be improved?

CATF research has identified numerous evidence-based ways to improve and streamline permitting and environmental reviews while maintaining public participation and rigorous scientific standards. These include finding new efficiencies in the NEPA process, such as transparent and rigorous consideration of regulatory categorical exclusions, tiering of reviews, and eliminating redundancies. Agencies and developers should also conduct 

early, sustained, and meaningful stakeholder engagement, which helps to ensure that projects avoid unnecessary opposition and delays. 

Meaningful reform to permitting and environmental review processes will not improve outcomes unless it addresses the challenges caused by leadership gaps, inconsistent and inadequate funding, a lack of sufficient staff with permitting expertise in agency headquarters and field offices, and insufficient coordination among federal agencies. Undermining NEPA will worsen environmental outcomes while bringing us no closer to clean energy deployment at scale. 


## Key recent NEPA actions 

Recent actions across all three branches of government have restricted the scope of NEPA implementation by creating disparate processes, limiting public engagement, and weakening the scientific robustness of reviews. These rollbacks risk: 

Reducing community input in decisions that directly affect public health and environment, which erodes trust in the clean energy transition 

- Increasing litigation risk, which can delay projects 
- Heightening uncertainty for developers, which increases project timelines and costs 
- Tracking NEPA-related developments in the Trump administration
