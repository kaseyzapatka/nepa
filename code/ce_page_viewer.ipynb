      "east of Sheridan Wyoming in Sheridan County. The allotment consists of about 2,100 total acres\n",
      "of which 6% is BLM land and 94% is deeded land. The lease authorizing grazing on the\n",
      "allotment includes a total of 120 acres of BLM land and 24 animal unit months (AUMs) of\n",
      "forage. Grazing use is authorized for cattle and sheep from 3/1-2/28. The Wyarno allotment is a\n",
      "\"Custodial\" allotment, meaning BLM management is impractical due to the combination of size\n",
      "and spacing of the BLM administered surface within the larger private ranch. The BLM parcels\n",

      "The current lessee has applied for renewal and/or issuance of the grazing lease authorizing grazing\n",
      "on the allotment associated with their lease. Per 43 CFR 4110, the grazing lessee has preference\n",
      "in retaining the grazing privileges attached to each property. If the proposed action is implemented,\n",

      "| Rationale: The proposed grazing lease renewal would not have significant impacts on such natural resources and unique geographic characteristics. It has been reviewed by all appropriate resource specialists. There are no ACECs, WSAs, designated wilderness areas, wild and scenic rivers, Monuments or other areas with special designations in the project area.

      "| Rationale: There are no highly controversial environment effects or unresolved conflicts concerning alternative uses of available resources.

      "| Rationale: This project does not have a direct relationship to other actions with individually insignificant but cumulatively significant environmental effects. Livestock grazing has occurred in the area for over 100 years. Approximately 24 total AUMs are authorized annually on this allotment. BLM anticipates no changes to authorized AUMs, season of use, and kind/number of livestock in the allotment. Livestock grazing will likely continue unless resources conditions or rangeland health assessments indicate otherwise. Additional activities associated with livestock grazing include: off-high way vehicle (OHV) travel, feeding of mineral and protein supplements, and hauling and trailing livestock. Hunting and recreational activities have occurred in the allotment for many years and are still a significant area land use. BLM expects these land uses to continue, with no material changes in these uses. Thresholds are not expected to be exceeded in the management of grazing or other BLM programs. | | |\n",
      "| 7. Have significant impacts on properties listed, or eligible for listing, on the National Register of Historic Places as determined by either the bureau or office. | [ ] | [x] |\n",
      "| Rationale: Class III pedestrian inventory has not occurred within the allotment and there are no known archaeological sites. There may be unrecorded archaeological sites, some which may be eligible for the NRHP, within the allotment. Per the State Protocol Between the Wyoming Bureau of Land Management State Director and The Wyoming State Historic Preservation Officer, section V(E)(iii) and Appendix B(26), grazing lease renewals that do not include seasonal grazing changes or changes in livestock types are exempt from SHPO consultation. The BLM electronically notified the Wyoming State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO) of this grazing lease renewal on August 17, 2018. | | |\n",
      "| 8. Have significant impacts on species listed, or proposed to be listed, on the List of Endangered or Threatened Species, or have significant impacts on designated Critical Habitat for these species. | [ ] | [x] |\n",
      "| Rationale: A wildlife review was conducted to determine if the project would have impacts on species listed, or proposed to be listed, as Endangered or Threatened Species, or have significant impacts on designated Critical Habitat for these species. The proposed action is consistent with the Buffalo Resource Management Plan (RMP)'s greater sage-grouse (GSG) management decisions. The Wyarno allotment is not located within GSG priority habitat. The allotment contains breeding, nesting, brood-rearing and wintering habitat. No documented GSG leks are within the allotment boundary. Ongoing livestock grazing is not expected to change the sage-grouse use of the area. Standard 4 requires that rangelands be capable of sustaining viable populations and a diversity of native plant and animal species. This includes greater sage-grouse. As noted above, an assessment of the S&Gs determined that the Wyarno allotment is meeting all | | |\n",

      "Ferruginous hawk, Black-tailed prairie dogs and Western burrowing owl (on\n",

      "the current levels will not affect these species.\n",
      "The Wyarno allotment does not contain habitat for any other species listed or\n",
      "proposed for listing under the Endangered Species Act. Livestock grazing has\n",
      "occurred in the area for decades and no additional impacts are anticipated if the\n",
      "proposed action is implemented.\n",
      "| 9. Violate a Federal law, or a State, local, or tribal law or requirement imposed for the protection of the environment. | [ ] | [x] |\n",
      "| Rationale: Federal, State, local or tribal laws or requirements for protecting the environment would not be violated with this project. | | |\n",
      "| 10. Have a disproportionately high and adverse effect on low income or minority populations (Executive Order 12898). | [ ] | [x] |\n",
      "| Rationale: None of the conditions in Executive Order 12898 apply to the project area for this effort. Therefore, implementation and potential environmental consequences of the action considered would not disproportionately affect any specific group of people (including any racial, ethnic, or socioeconomic group). | | |\n",
      "| 11. Limit access to and ceremonial use of Indian sacred sites on Federal lands by Indian religious practitioners or significantly adversely affect the physical integrity of such sacred sites (Executive Order 13007). | [ ] | [x] |\n",
      "| Rationale: The grazing lease renewal is not expected to limit access to and ceremonial use of Indian sacred sites on Federal lands by Indian religious practitioners or significantly adversely affect the physical integrity of such sacred sites. There are no known sacred sites within the proposed project area. | | |\n",
      "| 12. Contribute to the introduction, continued existence, or spread of noxious weeds or non-native invasive species known to occur in the area or actions that may promote the introduction, growth, or expansion of the range of such species (Federal Noxious Weed Control Act and Executive Order 13112). | [ ] | [x] |\n",
      "| Rationale: Invasive species and noxious weeds exist in the affected environment. The primary species in the area are downy brome (Bromus tectorum) and to a lesser extent, Japanese brome (Bromus japonicus). Downy brome, also referred to as cheatgrass, is present throughout the area and primarily exists along two track trails and other areas of disturbance. Downy brome is an invasive nonnative annual grass that can degrade native plant communities. Presently downy brome is not a major component of the allotment's native plant communities. BLM will aggressively treat current and future noxious weeds, which pose a risk to native vegetation on public lands using an integrated pest management (IPM) approach. | | |\n",

The repair is expected to consist of\\nlayering compatible rock material and BLM-approved Geotech material, then installing a culvert\\nand armoring the inlet and outlet of the culvert with local rock material from a nearby rock pile,\\nwithin BLM standards. The road repairs are expected to be completed by a contractor using\\nstandard road maintenance equipment (e.g., excavators, dozers, wheel loaders, and motor\\ngraders), and is expected to be completed by August 2021.\\n\\nThe road repair is expected to take approximately one week to complete, with potential road\\nclosure for one to two days if necessary. The repairs will require the removal of topsoil;\\ndisturbance will be no more than three feet below grade. On-site material will be used where\\npossible, including native rock from a rock pile approximately one mile northeast of the failure\\nsite (CX Appendix A, Figure 1). Construction activities will occur within 50 feet of the existing\\nroad. Some road closures during construction are unavoidable but the BLM will communicate\\nthese closures to the public in advance.\\n\\nDesign Features\\n1. A cultural monitor shall be present for any activity with the potential to create new\\nsurface disturbance outside of the alluvial drainage channel.\\n\\nDOI-BLM-CO-N010-2021-000048-CX_Decision Record\\n1\\n\\n**Page 2**\\n2. The following seed mix would be used for reclamation of any temporary re-route and any\\nother temporary construction disturbances after the permanent road repairs are\\ncompleted. Seeding would occur during the appropriate season to ensure seed\\nstratification (cold temperatures), germination, and establishment.

Ground disturbance from riprap collection will be remediated upon removal.\\n7. Fueling of equipment would only occur on existing ground disturbance. Any spills would\\nbe cleaned up immediately and disposed of properly.\\n8. The applicant is responsible for informing all persons who are associated with the project\\nthat they would be subject to prosecution for knowingly disturbing archaeological sites or\\nfor collecting artifacts.\\n9. If any archaeological materials are discovered as a result of operations under this\\nauthorization, activity in the vicinity of the discovery would cease, and the BLM LSFO\\n\\nDOI-BLM-CO-N010-2021-000048-CX_Decision Record\\n2\\n\\n**Page 3**\\nArchaeologist would be notified immediately. Work may not resume at that location until\\napproved by the Authorized Officer (AO). The applicant would make every effort to\\nprotect the site from further impacts including looting, erosion, or other human or natural\\ndamage until BLM determines a treatment approach, and the treatment is completed.\\nUnless previously determined in treatment plans or agreements, BLM would evaluate the\\ncultural resources and, in consultation with the State Historic Preservation Office\\n(SHPO), select the appropriate mitigation option within 48 hours of the discovery. The\\napplicant, under guidance of the BLM, would implement the mitigation in a timely\\nmanner. The process would be fully documented in reports, site forms, maps, drawings,\\nand photographs. The BLM would forward documentation to the SHPO for review and\\nconcurrence.\\n10. Pursuant to 43 CFR 10.4(g), the applicant must notify the AO, by telephone and written\\nconfirmation, immediately upon the discovery of human remains, funerary items, sacred\\nobjects, or objects of cultural patrimony. Further, pursuant to 43 CFR 10.4(c) and (d), the\\noperator must stop activities in the vicinity of the discovery and protect it for 30 days or\\nuntil notified to proceed by the AO.\\n11. The applicant is responsible for informing all persons who are associated with the project\\noperations that they would be subject to prosecution for disturbing or collecting\\nvertebrate or other scientifically important fossils, collecting large amounts of petrified\\nwood (over 25lbs./day, up to 250lbs./year), or collecting fossils for commercial purposes\\non public lands.\\n12. If any paleontological resources are discovered as a result of operations under this\\nauthorization, the applicant or any of his agents must stop work immediately at that site,\\nimmediately contact the BLM Paleontology Coordinator, and make every effort to protect\\nthe site from further impacts, including looting, erosion, or other human or natural\\ndamage. Work may not resume at that location until approved by the AO. The BLM or\\ndesignated paleontologist would evaluate the discovery and take action to protect or\\nremove the resource within 10 working days. Within 10 days, the operator would be\\nallowed to continue construction through the site or would be given the choice of either\\n(a) following the Paleontology Coordinator's instructions for stabilizing the fossil\\nresource in place and avoiding further disturbance to the fossil resource, or (b) following\\nthe Paleontology Coordinator's instructions for mitigating impacts to the fossil resource\\nprior to continuing construction through the project area.\\n\\nCompliance with Laws &amp; Conformance with the Land Use Plan\\nThis decision is in compliance with the Endangered Species Act and the National Historic\\nPreservation Act. It is also in conformance with the 2011 Little Snake Record of\\nDecision/Approved Resource Management Plan.\\n\\nEnvironmental Analysis and Finding of No Significant Impact\\nThe Proposed Action was reviewed in DOI-BLM-N010-2021-0043-CX.

The applicant is responsible for informing all persons who are associated with the project\\nthat they would be subject to prosecution for knowingly disturbing archaeological sites or\\nfor collecting artifacts.\\n9. If any archaeological materials are discovered as a result of operations under this\\nauthorization, activity in the vicinity of the discovery would cease, and the BLM LSFO\\nArchaeologist would be notified immediately. Work may not resume at that location until\\napproved by the Authorized Officer (AO). The applicant would make every effort to\\nprotect the site from further impacts including looting, erosion, or other human or natural\\ndamage until BLM determines a treatment approach, and the treatment is completed.\\nUnless previously determined in treatment plans or agreements, BLM would evaluate the\\ncultural resources and, in consultation with the State Historic Preservation Office\\n(SHPO), select the appropriate mitigation option within 48 hours of the discovery. The\\napplicant, under guidance of the BLM, would implement the mitigation in a timely\\nmanner. The process would be fully documented in reports, site forms, maps, drawings,\\nand photographs. The BLM would forward documentation to the SHPO for review and\\nconcurrence.\\n10. Pursuant to 43 CFR 10.4(g), the applicant must notify the AO, by telephone and written\\nconfirmation, immediately upon the discovery of human remains, funerary items, sacred\\nobjects, or objects of cultural patrimony. Further, pursuant to 43 CFR 10.4(c) and (d), the\\noperator must stop activities in the vicinity of the discovery and protect it for 30 days or\\nuntil notified to proceed by the AO.\\n11. The applicant is responsible for informing all persons who are associated with the project\\noperations that they would be subject to prosecution for disturbing or collecting\\nvertebrate or other scientifically important fossils, collecting large amounts of petrified\\nDOI-BLM-CO-N050-2021-0043-CX\\n3\\nwood (over 25lbs./day, up to 250lbs./year), or collecting fossils for commercial purposes\\non public lands.\\n12. If any paleontological resources are discovered as a result of operations under this\\nauthorization, the applicant or any of his agents must stop work immediately at that site,\\nimmediately contact the BLM Paleontology Coordinator, and make every effort to protect\\nthe site from further impacts, including looting, erosion, or other human or natural\\ndamage. Work may not resume at that location until approved by the AO. The BLM or\\ndesignated paleontologist would evaluate the discovery and take action to protect or\\nremove the resource within 10 working days. Within 10 days, the operator would be\\nallowed to continue construction through the site or would be given the choice of either\\n(a) following the Paleontology Coordinator's instructions for stabilizing the fossil\\nresource in place and avoiding further disturbance to the fossil resource, or (b) following\\nthe Paleontology Coordinator's instructions for mitigating impacts to the fossil resource\\nprior to continuing construction through the project area.\\nCategorical Exclusion Review\\nThe Proposed Action qualifies as a categorical exclusion under 516 DM 11.9, I1 for emergency\\nstabilization:\\n“Planned actions in response to wildfires, floods, weather events, earthquakes, or\\nlandslips that threaten public health or safety, property, and/or natural and cultural\\nresources, and that are necessary to repair or improve lands unlikely to recover to a\\nmanagement-approved condition as a result of the event. Such activities shall be limited\\nto: repair and installation of essential erosion control structures; replacement or repair\\nof existing culverts, roads, trails, fences, and minor facilities; construction of protection\\nfences; planting, seeding, and mulching; and removal of hazard trees, rocks, soil, and\\nother mobile debris from, on, or along roads, trails, campgrounds, and watercourses.\\nThese activities:\\na.

A review of existing records was\\ncompleted to determine the extent of previous cultural resource surveys and the location of\\nrecorded sites in relation to the road repair and native rock pile locations. A small number (three:\\nMC.E.R12/21-85; MC.LM.R45/13-81; MF.LM.R249/10-94) of previous cultural inventories\\noccurred within a one-mile radius around the two locations; none of which intersected with the\\nproposed project areas. While cultural inventories in the area are limited, they did reveal\\nmoderate site density around Sagebrush Draw; therefore, a Class III pedestrian survey was\\nwarranted.\\nOn May 8, 2021, BLM Colorado Northwest District archaeologist Wendy Parker surveyed a\\ntotal of 1.6 acres (0.8 acres at each location) around the road damage and rock pile locations. The\\nsurvey yielded negative results; therefore, the undertaking would have no effect on historic\\nproperties and no further archaeological work is necessary.\\nNative American Religious Concerns: Lacking a written, formal agreement outlining a\\nconsultation process between BLM-LSFO and the relevant tribes, the field office policy is to\\nconsult with tribes when the proposed undertaking is within or in the vicinity of an area known\\nto be of concern to the tribes or when the undertaking involves sites of the kind that experience\\nhas shown would be of tribal concern. Such sites include burials, rock art, wickiups, stone circle\\nsites, possible vision quest sites, possible eagle traps, etc. As the road damage and rock\\nprocurement area is not in or near an area of known concern to the tribes, nor would it be in the\\nvicinity of sites of the kind that are of tribal concern, it is concluded that proposed undertaking\\nwould not affect areas or sites of Native American concern.\\nTribes, Individuals, Organizations, or Agencies Consulted\\nNone.\\nReferences Cited\\nBureau of Land Management.

on BLM Road 1509\\nDOI-BLM-CO-N010-2021-0043-CX\\n\\nDecision\\nIt is my decision to implement the Proposed Action, as described in DOI-BLM-CO-N010-2021-\\n0043-CX, authorizing the emergency repair of BLM Road 1509 in Moffat County, Colorado,\\nnear the Little Snake/White River Field Office boundary. The repair is expected to consist of\\nlayering compatible rock material and BLM-approved Geotech material, then installing a culvert\\nand armoring the inlet and outlet of the culvert with local rock material from a nearby rock pile,\\nwithin BLM standards. The road repairs are expected to be completed by a contractor using\\nstandard road maintenance equipment (e.g., excavators, dozers, wheel loaders, and motor\\ngraders), and is expected to be completed by August 2021.\\n\\nThe road repair is expected to take approximately one week to complete, with potential road\\nclosure for one to two days if necessary. The repairs will require the removal of topsoil;\\ndisturbance will be no more than three feet below grade. On-site material will be used where\\npossible, including native rock from a rock pile approximately one mile northeast of the failure\\nsite (CX Appendix A, Figure 1). Construction activities will occur within 50 feet of the existing\\nroad. Some road closures during construction are unavoidable but the BLM will communicate\\nthese closures to the public in advance.\\n\\nDesign Features\\n1. A cultural monitor shall be present for any activity with the potential to create new\\nsurface disturbance outside of the alluvial drainage channel.\\n\\nDOI-BLM-CO-N010-2021-000048-CX_Decision Record\\n1\\n\\n**Page 2**\\n2. The following seed mix would be used for reclamation of any temporary re-route and any\\nother temporary construction disturbances after the permanent road repairs are\\ncompleted. Seeding would occur during the appropriate season to ensure seed\\nstratification (cold temperatures), germination, and establishment. Fall seeding is\\nrecommended following project completion.\\n\\nApplication\\nRate\\nCultivar\\nCommon Name\\nScientific Name\\n(lbs PLS/acre)\\nMagnar\\nBasin wildrye\\nLeymus cinereus\\n2.0\\nRosana\\nWestern Wheatgrass\\nPascopyrum smithii\\n3.0\\nBluebunch wheatgrass\\nPseudoroegneria spicata\\n1.0\\nCritana\\nThickspike Wheatgrass\\nElymus lanceolatus ssp.\\nlanceolatus\\n2.0\\nScarlet Globemallow\\nSphaeralcea coccinea\\n1.0\\nWestern yarrow\\nAchillea millefolium\\n0.5\\nFourwing saltbush\\nAtriplex canescens\\n1.0\\n\\n3.

The road repairs are expected to take place by\\nAugust 2021.\\nPermanent road repairs would mostly likely be completed by a contractor.\\nThe road repair would take approximately one week to complete, with potential road closure for\\none to two days if necessary.\\nPermanent road repairs would be designed and implemented under the direction of a BLM\\nEngineer. The permanent road repairs essentially involve filling the road foundation with stable\\nmaterials such as large rock (riprap) and graded aggregates. To reduce costs, the BLM would\\nseek to use on-site material where possible, including native rock from a rock pile approximately\\none mile northeast of the failure site (Appendix A, Figure 1). Construction activities would occur\\nwithin 50 feet of the existing road. Some road closures during construction are unavoidable but\\nthe BLM would communicate these closures to the public in advance.\\nThe permanent repairs would require the removal of topsoil; disturbance would be no more than\\nthree feet below grade. Standard road maintenance equipment would be used (e.g., excavators,\\ndozers, wheel loaders, and motor graders).\\nDesign Features\\n1. A cultural monitor shall be present for any activity with the potential to create new\\nsurface disturbance outside of the alluvial drainage channel.\\n2. The following seed mix would be used for reclamation of any temporary re-route and any\\nother temporary construction disturbances after the permanent road repairs are\\ncompleted. Seeding would occur during the appropriate season to ensure seed\\nstratification (cold temperatures), germination, and establishment. Fall seeding is\\nrecommended following project completion.\\nCultivar\\nCommon Name\\nMagnar Basin wildrye\\nRosana\\nWestern Wheatgrass\\nBluebunch wheatgrass\\nCritana\\nThickspike Wheatgrass\\nScarlet Globemallow\\nWestern yarrow\\nFourwing saltbush\\nDOI-BLM-CO-N050-2021-0043-CX\\nScientific Name\\nLeymus cinereus\\nPascopyrum smithii\\nPseudoroegneria spicata\\nElymus lanceolatus ssp.\\nlanceolatus\\nSphaeralcea coccinea\\nAchillea millefolium\\nAtriplex canescens\\nApplication\\nRate\\n(lbs PLS/acre)\\n2.0\\n3.0\\n1.0\\n2.0\\n1.0\\n0.5\\n1.0\\n2\\n3.

A review of existing records was\\ncompleted to determine the extent of previous cultural resource surveys and the location of\\nrecorded sites in relation to the road repair and native rock pile locations. A small number (three:\\nMC.E.R12/21-85; MC.LM.R45/13-81; MF.LM.R249/10-94) of previous cultural inventories\\noccurred within a one-mile radius around the two locations; none of which intersected with the\\nproposed project areas. While cultural inventories in the area are limited, they did reveal\\nmoderate site density around Sagebrush Draw; therefore, a Class III pedestrian survey was\\nwarranted.\\nOn May 8, 2021, BLM Colorado Northwest District archaeologist Wendy Parker surveyed a\\ntotal of 1.6 acres (0.8 acres at each location) around the road damage and rock pile locations. The\\nsurvey yielded negative results; therefore, the undertaking would have no effect on historic\\nproperties and no further archaeological work is necessary.\\nNative American Religious Concerns: Lacking a written, formal agreement outlining a\\nconsultation process between BLM-LSFO and the relevant tribes, the field office policy is to\\nconsult with tribes when the proposed undertaking is within or in the vicinity of an area known\\nto be of concern to the tribes or when the undertaking involves sites of the kind that experience\\nhas shown would be of tribal concern. Such sites include burials, rock art, wickiups, stone circle\\nsites, possible vision quest sites, possible eagle traps, etc. As the road damage and rock\\nprocurement area is not in or near an area of known concern to the tribes, nor would it be in the\\nvicinity of sites of the kind that are of tribal concern, it is concluded that proposed undertaking\\nwould not affect areas or sites of Native American concern.\\nTribes, Individuals, Organizations, or Agencies Consulted\\nNone.\\nReferences Cited\\nBureau of Land Management.
