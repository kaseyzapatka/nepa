Under\\nthe statutes, the BLM is required to develop regulations to manage public land resources on a\\nmultiple-use and sustained yield basis. Management of grazing on BLM land within the\\nplanning area will be in accordance with the grazing administration regulations found in 43\\nCFR Part 4100. The purpose of the grazing regulations is to manage the livestock grazing\\nprogram as an integral part of the overall multiple-use of the public lands.”\\nStandards for Rangeland Health and Guidelines for Livestock Grazing Management\\nEnvironmental Impact Statement (5/1997):\\nStandards are statements of physical and biological condition, or degree of function required\\nfor healthy sustainable rangelands.

Compliance with NEPA:\\n\\nThe proposed action is categorically excluded from further documentation under the\\nNational Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) in accordance with the following:\\n\\n[ ] 43 CFR 46.210, or\\n[x] 516 DM 11.9\\n\\nCompliance with FLPMA Section 402(h)(1) Criteria for Application of Categorical Exclusion\\nused to Issue a Grazing Permit or Lease:\\n\\n1. The permit or lease continues the current grazing management of the allotments(s).\\n2. A land health assessment and evaluation have been completed in accordance with\\nManual Handbook H-4180-1.\\n3. The Authorized Officer concludes from the finding of the evaluation report that:\\na. The public land subject to the evaluation is meeting land health standards, or\\nb. The public land subject to the evaluation is not meeting standards due to\\nfactors other than current livestock grazing.\\n\\nCompliance with IM-2015-121:\\n\\n1. Existing grazing is consistent with land use plan and any applicable allotment\\nmanagement plan objectives and decisions. Most recent Evaluation Report and Land\\nHealth Determination and any subsequently collected monitoring data documents that\\nthe allotment(s) included in the permit meet land health standards or that factors other\\nthan existing livestock grazing are the cause for allotment(s) failing to meet the\\nstandards.\\n\\nAppropriate CX Number and Text, or Paraphrase of the Text:\\n\\nD. Rangeland Management (1): Approval of transfers of grazing preference.\\n\\nThe proposed action has been reviewed and none of the extraordinary circumstances described in\\n43 CFR 46.215 applies. This categorical exclusion is appropriate in this situation because there\\nare no extraordinary circumstances potentially having significant effects on the environment.\\n\\nExplanation of Why There is no Potential for Significant Impacts:\\n1. Have significant impact on public health or safety.\\nYes [ ] No [x] Rationale: The proposed action will not have a significant impact on public health or safety\\nbecause there are no proposed changes to the grazing permit. The proposed action is an\\nadministrative action.\\n2. Have significant impact on such natural resources and unique geographic characteristics as historic or\\ncultural resources; park, recreation or refuge lands; wilderness areas; wild or scenic rivers; national\\nnatural landmarks; sole or principle drinking water aquifers; prime farmlands; wetlands (Executive\\nOrder 11991; Floodplains (Executive Order 11988); national monuments; migratory birds; and other\\necologically significant or critical areas.\\nYes [ ] No [x] Rationale: There are no proposed changes to the current grazing permit. The proposed\\naction is an administrative action and therefore, there are no impacts to any of the\\naforementioned natural resources because the terms and conditions (kind and number of\\nlivestock, period of use, area to be used, and amount of use) of the current term grazing\\npermit will remain the same. Since there are no additional changes other than a name\\nchange, there will be no change from the baseline for natural resources and no further\\nanalysis are warranted.\\n3. Have highly controversial environmental effects or involve unresolved conflict concerning alternative\\nuses of available resources [NEPA section 102(2)(E)].\\nYes [ ] No [x] Rationale: The proposed action is an administrative action and will not have highly\\ncontroversial environmental effects or involve unresolved conflict concerning alternative\\nuses of available resources because it will not authorize new resource uses beyond what\\ncurrently exist. A Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) was signed on July 2009\\npertaining to the existing terms and conditions of the permit analyzed in the Snowies-Little\\nBelts Grazing Permit Renewal Environmental Assessment (EA #MT-060-08-52).\\n4. Have highly uncertain and potentially significant environmental effects or involve unique or unknown\\nenvironmental risks.\\nYes [ ] No [x] Rationale: The proposed action is an administrative action and would not have highly\\nuncertain and potentially significant environmental effects or involve unique or unknown\\nenvironment risks because it will not authorize new resource uses beyond what currently\\nexist. Based on ID Team review, new circumstances were not identified and the\\nconsequences of the proposed action remain certain. A Finding of No Significant Impact\\n(FONSI) was signed on July 2009, pertaining to the existing terms and conditions of the\\npermit analyzed in the Snowies-Little Belts Grazing Permit Renewal Environmental\\nAssessment (EA #MT-060-08-52).\\n5. Establish a precedent for future action or represent a decision in principle about future actions with\\npotentially significant environmental effects.\\nYes [ ] No [x] Rationale: The proposed action is an administrative action and will not establish precedent\\nfor future actions and does not represent a decision in principle about future actions with\\npotentially significant environmental effects because it complies with current Federal\\nRegulations (CFR §4100), The National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, and will not\\nauthorize new resource uses beyond what currently exist. A Finding of No Significant Impact\\n(FONSI) was signed on July 2009, pertaining to the existing terms and conditions of the\\npermit analyzed in the Snowies-Little Belts Grazing Permit Renewal Environmental\\nAssessment (EA #MT-060-08-52).\\n6. Have a direct relationship to other actions with individually insignificant but cumulative significant\\nenvironmental effects.\\nYes [ ] No [x] Rationale: The proposed action is an administrative action and does not have a direct\\nrelationship to other actions with individually insignificant but cumulative significant\\nenvironmental effects. The proposed action is consistent with current Federal Regulations\\n(CFR §4100), The National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, and will not authorize new\\nresource uses beyond what currently exist. A Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) was\\nsigned on July 2009, pertaining to the existing terms and conditions of the permit analyzed\\nunder the Snowies-Little Belts Grazing Permit Renewal Environmental Assessment (EA\\n#MT-060-08-52).\\n7. Have significant impact on properties listed, or eligible for listing, on the National Register of Historic\\nPlaces as determined by the bureau.\\n\\nYes [ ] No [x] Rationale: The proposed action is an administrative name change and will not have\\nsignificant impacts on properties listed or eligible for listing, on the National Register of\\nHistoric Places as determined by the Bureau due to the lack of known properties eligible for\\nor listed on the National Register.\\n8. Have significant impacts on species listed, or proposed to be listed, on the List of Endangered or\\nThreatened Species or have significant impacts on designated Critical Habitat for these species.\\nYes [ ] No [x] Rationale: The proposed action is an administrative name change and will not have\\nsignificant impacts on species listed, or proposed to be listed, on the List of Endangered or\\nThreatened Species or have significant impacts on designated Critical Habitat for wildlife\\nspecies because the terms and conditions (kind and number of livestock, period of use, area\\nto be used and amount of use) of the current term grazing permit will remain the same. There\\nwill be no change from the baseline for wildlife, T&E Species, or BLM Sensitive Species,\\nincluding Greater Sage-Grouse and no further analysis is warranted. A Finding of No\\nSignificant Impact was signed on July 2009, pertaining to the existing terms and conditions\\nof the permit analyzed under the Snowies-Little Belts Grazing Permit Renewal\\nEnvironmental Assessment (EA #MT-060-08-52).\\n9. Violate a Federal law, or a State, local, or tribal law or requirement imposed for the protection of the\\nenvironment.\\nYes [ ] No [x] Rationale: The proposed action is an administrative name change and will not violate a\\nFederal law, or a State, local, or tribal law or requirement imposed for the protection of the\\nenvironment because it complies with current Federal Regulations (CFR §4100), The\\nNational Environmental Policy Act of 1969, and will not authorize new resource uses beyond\\nwhat currently exist.\\n10. Have a disproportionately high and adverse effect on low income or minority populations (Executive\\nOrder 12898).\\nYes [ ] No [x] Rationale: The proposed action is an administrative name change and will not have a\\ndisproportionately high and adverse effect on low income or minority populations because\\nthe proposed action will not authorize new resource uses beyond what currently exist.\\n11. Limit access to and ceremonial use of Indian sacred sites on Federal lands by Indian religious\\npractitioners or significantly adversely affect the physical integrity of such sacred sites (Executive Order\\n13007).\\nYes [ ] No [x] Rationale: The proposed action is an administrative name change only and will have no\\nimpact to access or ceremonial use, nor will it significantly adversely affect the physical\\nintegrity of such sites.\\n12. Contribute to the introduction, continued existence, or spread of noxious weeds or non-native invasive\\nspecies known to occur in the area or action that may promote the introduction, growth, or expansion of\\nthe range of such species (Federal Noxious Weed Control Act and Executive Order 13112).\\nYes [ ] No [x] Rationale: The proposed action is an administrative name change and does not contribute to\\nthe introduction or spread of noxious weeds.\\n\\nD: Signature\\n\\nI considered this review and determined that the proposed action is in conformance with the land\\nuse plan and is categorically excluded from further environmental analysis. It is my decision to\\napprove the proposed action.\\n\\nPertinent design features, stipulations or mitigation (if applicable):\\n\\nAuthorizing Official: Peter G.

Under\\nthe statutes, the BLM is required to develop regulations to manage public land resources on a\\nmultiple-use and sustained yield basis. Management of grazing on BLM land within the\\nplanning area will be in accordance with the grazing administration regulations found in 43\\nCFR Part 4100. The purpose of the grazing regulations is to manage the livestock grazing\\nprogram as an integral part of the overall multiple-use of the public lands.”\\nStandards for Rangeland Health and Guidelines for Livestock Grazing Management\\nEnvironmental Impact Statement (5/1997):\\nStandards are statements of physical and biological condition, or degree of function required\\nfor healthy sustainable rangelands. Achieving or making significant and measureable progress\\ntowards these functions and conditions is required of all uses of public rangelands. Historical\\ndata, when available, should be used when assessing progress towards these standards.\\n\\nC. Compliance with NEPA:\\n\\nThe proposed action is categorically excluded from further documentation under the\\nNational Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) in accordance with the following:\\n\\n[ ] 43 CFR 46.210, or\\n[x] 516 DM 11.9\\n\\nCompliance with FLPMA Section 402(h)(1) Criteria for Application of Categorical Exclusion\\nused to Issue a Grazing Permit or Lease:\\n\\n1. The permit or lease continues the current grazing management of the allotments(s).\\n2. A land health assessment and evaluation have been completed in accordance with\\nManual Handbook H-4180-1.\\n3. The Authorized Officer concludes from the finding of the evaluation report that:\\na. The public land subject to the evaluation is meeting land health standards, or\\nb. The public land subject to the evaluation is not meeting standards due to\\nfactors other than current livestock grazing.\\n\\nCompliance with IM-2015-121:\\n\\n1. Existing grazing is consistent with land use plan and any applicable allotment\\nmanagement plan objectives and decisions. Most recent Evaluation Report and Land\\nHealth Determination and any subsequently collected monitoring data documents that\\nthe allotment(s) included in the permit meet land health standards or that factors other\\nthan existing livestock grazing are the cause for allotment(s) failing to meet the\\nstandards.\\n\\nAppropriate CX Number and Text, or Paraphrase of the Text:\\n\\nD. Rangeland Management (1): Approval of transfers of grazing preference.\\n\\nThe proposed action has been reviewed and none of the extraordinary circumstances described in\\n43 CFR 46.215 applies. This categorical exclusion is appropriate in this situation because there\\nare no extraordinary circumstances potentially having significant effects on the environment.\\n\\nExplanation of Why There is no Potential for Significant Impacts:\\n1. Have significant impact on public health or safety.\\nYes [ ] No [x] Rationale: The proposed action will not have a significant impact on public health or safety\\nbecause there are no proposed changes to the grazing permit. The proposed action is an\\nadministrative action.\\n2. Have significant impact on such natural resources and unique geographic characteristics as historic or\\ncultural resources; park, recreation or refuge lands; wilderness areas; wild or scenic rivers; national\\nnatural landmarks; sole or principle drinking water aquifers; prime farmlands; wetlands (Executive\\nOrder 11991; Floodplains (Executive Order 11988); national monuments; migratory birds; and other\\necologically significant or critical areas.\\nYes [ ] No [x] Rationale: There are no proposed changes to the current grazing permit. The proposed\\naction is an administrative action and therefore, there are no impacts to any of the\\naforementioned natural resources because the terms and conditions (kind and number of\\nlivestock, period of use, area to be used, and amount of use) of the current term grazing\\npermit will remain the same. Since there are no additional changes other than a name\\nchange, there will be no change from the baseline for natural resources and no further\\nanalysis are warranted.\\n3. Have highly controversial environmental effects or involve unresolved conflict concerning alternative\\nuses of available resources [NEPA section 102(2)(E)].\\nYes [ ] No [x] Rationale: The proposed action is an administrative action and will not have highly\\ncontroversial environmental effects or involve unresolved conflict concerning alternative\\nuses of available resources because it will not authorize new resource uses beyond what\\ncurrently exist. A Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) was signed on July 2009\\npertaining to the existing terms and conditions of the permit analyzed in the Snowies-Little\\nBelts Grazing Permit Renewal Environmental Assessment (EA #MT-060-08-52).\\n4. Have highly uncertain and potentially significant environmental effects or involve unique or unknown\\nenvironmental risks.\\nYes [ ] No [x] Rationale: The proposed action is an administrative action and would not have highly\\nuncertain and potentially significant environmental effects or involve unique or unknown\\nenvironment risks because it will not authorize new resource uses beyond what currently\\nexist. Based on ID Team review, new circumstances were not identified and the\\nconsequences of the proposed action remain certain. A Finding of No Significant Impact\\n(FONSI) was signed on July 2009, pertaining to the existing terms and conditions of the\\npermit analyzed in the Snowies-Little Belts Grazing Permit Renewal Environmental\\nAssessment (EA #MT-060-08-52).\\n5. Establish a precedent for future action or represent a decision in principle about future actions with\\npotentially significant environmental effects.\\nYes [ ] No [x] Rationale: The proposed action is an administrative action and will not establish precedent\\nfor future actions and does not represent a decision in principle about future actions with\\npotentially significant environmental effects because it complies with current Federal\\nRegulations (CFR §4100), The National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, and will not\\nauthorize new resource uses beyond what currently exist. A Finding of No Significant Impact\\n(FONSI) was signed on July 2009, pertaining to the existing terms and conditions of the\\npermit analyzed in the Snowies-Little Belts Grazing Permit Renewal Environmental\\nAssessment (EA #MT-060-08-52).\\n6. Have a direct relationship to other actions with individually insignificant but cumulative significant\\nenvironmental effects.\\nYes [ ] No [x] Rationale: The proposed action is an administrative action and does not have a direct\\nrelationship to other actions with individually insignificant but cumulative significant\\nenvironmental effects. The proposed action is consistent with current Federal Regulations\\n(CFR §4100), The National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, and will not authorize new\\nresource uses beyond what currently exist. A Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) was\\nsigned on July 2009, pertaining to the existing terms and conditions of the permit analyzed\\nunder the Snowies-Little Belts Grazing Permit Renewal Environmental Assessment (EA\\n#MT-060-08-52).\\n7. Have significant impact on properties listed, or eligible for listing, on the National Register of Historic\\nPlaces as determined by the bureau.\\n\\nYes [ ] No [x] Rationale: The proposed action is an administrative name change and will not have\\nsignificant impacts on properties listed or eligible for listing, on the National Register of\\nHistoric Places as determined by the Bureau due to the lack of known properties eligible for\\nor listed on the National Register.\\n8. Have significant impacts on species listed, or proposed to be listed, on the List of Endangered or\\nThreatened Species or have significant impacts on designated Critical Habitat for these species.\\nYes [ ] No [x] Rationale: The proposed action is an administrative name change and will not have\\nsignificant impacts on species listed, or proposed to be listed, on the List of Endangered or\\nThreatened Species or have significant impacts on designated Critical Habitat for wildlife\\nspecies because the terms and conditions (kind and number of livestock, period of use, area\\nto be used and amount of use) of the current term grazing permit will remain the same. There\\nwill be no change from the baseline for wildlife, T&E Species, or BLM Sensitive Species,\\nincluding Greater Sage-Grouse and no further analysis is warranted. A Finding of No\\nSignificant Impact was signed on July 2009, pertaining to the existing terms and conditions\\nof the permit analyzed under the Snowies-Little Belts Grazing Permit Renewal\\nEnvironmental Assessment (EA #MT-060-08-52).\\n9. Violate a Federal law, or a State, local, or tribal law or requirement imposed for the protection of the\\nenvironment.\\nYes [ ] No [x] Rationale: The proposed action is an administrative name change and will not violate a\\nFederal law, or a State, local, or tribal law or requirement imposed for the protection of the\\nenvironment because it complies with current Federal Regulations (CFR §4100), The\\nNational Environmental Policy Act of 1969, and will not authorize new resource uses beyond\\nwhat currently exist.\\n10. Have a disproportionately high and adverse effect on low income or minority populations (Executive\\nOrder 12898).\\nYes [ ] No [x] Rationale: The proposed action is an administrative name change and will not have a\\ndisproportionately high and adverse effect on low income or minority populations because\\nthe proposed action will not authorize new resource uses beyond what currently exist.\\n11. Limit access to and ceremonial use of Indian sacred sites on Federal lands by Indian religious\\npractitioners or significantly adversely affect the physical integrity of such sacred sites (Executive Order\\n13007).\\nYes [ ] No [x] Rationale: The proposed action is an administrative name change only and will have no\\nimpact to access or ceremonial use, nor will it significantly adversely affect the physical\\nintegrity of such sites.\\n12. Contribute to the introduction, continued existence, or spread of noxious weeds or non-native invasive\\nspecies known to occur in the area or action that may promote the introduction, growth, or expansion of\\nthe range of such species (Federal Noxious Weed Control Act and Executive Order 13112).\\nYes [ ] No [x] Rationale: The proposed action is an administrative name change and does not contribute to\\nthe introduction or spread of noxious weeds.\\n\\nD: Signature\\n\\nI considered this review and determined that the proposed action is in conformance with the land\\nuse plan and is categorically excluded from further environmental analysis. It is my decision to\\napprove the proposed action.\\n\\nPertinent design features, stipulations or mitigation (if applicable):\\n\\nAuthorizing Official: Peter G.

If utilization is approaching allowable use levels, livestock should be moved to another\\nportion of the allotment, or removed from the allotment entirely for the remainder of the\\ngrowing season. Adaptive management will be applied to ensure long-term management\\nobjectives and land health standards are achieved. Utilization limits may be adjusted\\n(increased or decreased) depending on current resource conditions and trends.\\n\\n5. All public motorized and mechanized travel is limited to designated routes. Grazing\\npermittees will maintain administrative access specifically for livestock operations and\\nmaintenance activities, as follows: 1. motorized access on designated routes that are closed to\\npublic motorized use; 2. motorized access in areas seasonally closed to public motorized use;\\nand 3. motorized access off designated routes (e.g., fence maintenance). Administrative\\naccess is valid for grazing administration only and not for other purposes such as four-\\nwheelings or big game hunting.\\n\\n6. Maintenance of range improvements is required and shall be in accordance with all\\napproved cooperative agreements and range improvement permits/leases. Maintenance\\nshall be completed prior to turnout. Maintenance activities shall be restricted to the\\nfootprint (previously disturbed area) of the project as it existed when it was initially\\nconstructed. The Bureau of Land Management shall be given 48 hours advance notice of\\nany maintenance work that will involve heavy equipment. Disturbed areas will be reseeded\\nwith a certified weed-free seed mixture of native species adapted to the site.\\n\\n7. The permittee/lessees and all persons associated with grazing operations must be informed\\nthat any person who injures, destroys, excavates, appropriates or removes any historic or\\nprehistoric ruin, artifact, object of antiquity, Native American remains, Native American\\ncultural item, or archaeological resources on public lands is subject to arrest and penalty of\\nlaw. If in connection with allotment operations under this authorization any of the above\\nresources are encountered, the proponent shall immediately suspend all activities in the\\nimmediate vicinity of the discovery that might further disturb such materials and notify the\\nBLM authorized officer of the findings. The discovery must be protected until further\\nnotified in writing to proceed by the authorized officer.\\n\\n8. The permittee is responsible for informing all persons who are associated with project\\noperations that they will be subject to prosecution for disturbing or collecting vertebrate or\\nother scientifically-important fossils, collecting large amounts of petrified wood (over 25\\nlbs/day, up to 250 lbs/year), or collecting fossils for commercial purposes on public lands. If\\nany paleontological resources are discovered as a result of operations under this\\nauthorization, the applicant must immediately contact the appropriate BLM representative.\\n\\n3 DOI-BLM-CO-N040-2017-0010-CX | BLM - Colorado River Valley Field Office\\n\\nLAND USE PLAN CONFORMANCE.\\nThe Proposed Action is subject to and has been reviewed for conformance with the following\\nplan (43 CFR 1610.5, BLM 1617.3).\\n\\nName of Plan.

Six sites (5GF.4263, 5GF.524, 5GF.527, 5GF.528, 5GF.529, 5GF.4184) are\\nrecommended to be revisited and monitored during the term of this permit. Continued use of the\\nallotment in livestock kind, number, or season of use will not likely have impacts to cultural\\nresources. This information does not bring to light any changes to the previous analysis and no\\nnew areas of inventory are needed and no cultural resources need to be monitored. New range\\nimprovements, maintenance of existing range improvements, or additional feeding areas may\\nrequire cultural resource inventories, monitoring, and/or data recovery.\\n\\nThe cultural resource evaluation of this allotment describing known cultural resources and their\\ncondition was sent to the Southern Ute Indian Tribe, Ute Mountain Ute Tribe, and the Uinta and\\nOuray Agency Ute Indian Tribe. The letter, sent on December 16, 2011, requested the tribes to\\nidentify issues and areas of concern within the allotment.

To be\\nrenewed the permit has undergone review for conformance with the land use plan and\\ncompliance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). The review and NEPA\\ncompliance has been completed as documented in Categorical Exclusion (CX) No. DOI-BLM-\\nCO-N040-2017-0010. A copy of the CX is enclosed. Renewal of the permit has also been\\nreviewed for compliance with 43 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 4110.1(b)(1) which\\nrequires a satisfactory record of performance prior to renewal.\\n\\nProposed Decision.\\nAs a result of this process, it is my proposed decision to renew grazing permit #0501971. My\\nproposed decision results in the authorized use described in Tables 1 and 2 and the terms and\\nconditions identified below.\\n\\nPage | 1\\n\\nTable 1. Proposed Grazing Schedules.\\n| Operator Name        | Auth. No. | Allotment & Number | Livestock Number | Livestock Kind | Begin Date | End Date | % BLM Land | AUMs |\\n| :------------------- | :-------- | :------------------ | :----------------- | :--------------- | :--------- | :-------- | :----------- | :----- |\\n| Frank & Sheila Daley | 0501971   | Whitman No. 08102   | 60                 | Cattle           | 05/01      | 5/31      | 100          | 61     |\\n\\nTable 2. Proposed Permitted Use AUMs.\\n| Operator Name        | Auth. No. | Allotment & Number | Active AUMs | Suspended AUMs | Temporary Suspended AUMs | Permitted Use |\\n| :------------------- | :-------- | :------------------ | :------------ | :--------------- | :----------------------- | :-------------- |\\n| Frank & Sheila Daley | 0501971   | Whitman No. 08102   | 63            | 119              | 0                        | 182             |\\n\\nTerms and Conditions.\\n1. Adaptive management will be employed on the Whitman Allotment. The BLM will allow up\\nto 14 days of flexibility in the start and end dates on this permit depending on range\\nreadiness. AUMs may not exceed Active Preference. Grazing use different than that shown\\nabove must be applied for in advance.\\n\\n2. An actual use report shall be submitted annually to the BLM office no later than 15 days after\\nlivestock have been removed (i.e. the grazing end period on the bill or permit/lease).\\n\\n3. Livestock Grazing Utilization Guidelines. Average utilization levels by livestock should not\\nexceed.\\nUpland areas:\\n• 40% on key grass species during the critical growth period and\\n• 50% during the dormant season.\\nRiparian areas:\\n• average minimum four-inch stubble height on key species for mid-to-late summer\\ngrazing period;\\n• average minimum six-inch stubble height for late summer-early fall grazing; and\\n• no more than 30% use of current year\\'s growth on woody species.\\n\\n4. If utilization is approaching allowable use levels, livestock should be moved to another\\nportion of the allotment, or removed from the allotment entirely for the remainder of the\\ngrowing season. Adaptive management will be applied to ensure long-term management\\nobjectives and land health standards are achieved. Utilization limits may be adjusted\\n(increased or decreased) depending on current resource conditions and trends.\\n\\nPage | 2\\n\\n5. All public motorized and mechanized travel is limited to designated routes. Grazing\\npermittees will maintain administrative access specifically for livestock operations and\\nmaintenance activities, as follows: 1. motorized access on designated routes that are closed to\\npublic motorized use; 2. motorized access in areas seasonally closed to public motorized use;\\nand 3. motorized access off designated routes (e.g., fence maintenance). Administrative\\naccess is valid for grazing administration only and not for other purposes such as four-\\nwheeling or big game hunting.\\n\\n6. Maintenance of range improvements is required and shall be in accordance with all\\napproved cooperative agreements and range improvement permits/leases. Maintenance\\nshall be completed prior to turnout. Maintenance activities shall be restricted to the\\nfootprint (previously disturbed area) of the project as it existed when it was initially\\nconstructed. The Bureau of Land Management shall be given 48 hours advance notice of\\nany maintenance work that will involve heavy equipment. Disturbed areas will be reseeded\\nwith a certified weed-free seed mixture of native species adapted to the site.\\n\\n7. The permittee/lessees and all persons associated with grazing operations must be informed\\nthat any person who injures, destroys, excavates, appropriates or removes any historic or\\nprehistoric ruin, artifact, object of antiquity, Native American remains, Native American\\ncultural item, or archaeological resources on public lands is subject to arrest and penalty of\\nlaw. If in connection with allotment operations under this authorization any of the above\\nresources are encountered, the proponent shall immediately suspend all activities in the\\nimmediate vicinity of the discovery that might further disturb such materials and notify the\\nBLM authorized officer of the findings. The discovery must be protected until further\\nnotified in writing to proceed by the authorized officer.\\n\\n8. The permittee is responsible for informing all persons who are associated with project\\noperations that they will be subject to prosecution for disturbing or collecting vertebrate or\\nother scientifically-important fossils, collecting large amounts of petrified wood (over 25\\nlbs/day, up to 250 lbs/year), or collecting fossils for commercial purposes on public lands. If\\nany paleontological resources are discovered as a result of operations under this\\nauthorization, the applicant must immediately contact the appropriate BLM representative.\\n\\nRationale for the Proposed Decision.\\nAn interdisciplinary team prepared CX #DOI-BLM-CO-N040-2017-0010. My proposed\\ndecision to renew the grazing permit is based on the findings contained in the CX, conformance\\nwith the 2015 Colorado River Valley Field Office Record of Decision (ROD) and Approved\\nResource Management Plan (RMP) and achieving Colorado\\'s Land Health Standards for Public\\nLand.\\n\\nThe permit continues the current grazing management on the Whitman Allotment. A land\\nhealth assessment and evaluation (Divide Creek Landscape Land Health Assessment) have been\\ncompleted in accordance with Manual Handbook H-4180-1. The authorized officer concluded\\n\\nPage | 3\\n\\nfrom the findings of the evaluation report that the BLM land subject to the evaluation is not\\nmeeting standards due to factors other than current livestock grazing.\\n\\nThe findings indicate that continuing the current grazing management on the Whitman Allotment\\nis consistent with Colorado\\'s Guidelines for Livestock Grazing Management. It is anticipated\\nthat grazing management practices will promote healthy rangelands by maintaining sufficient\\nresidual vegetation and providing adequate recovery and regrowth periods. Terms and\\nconditions have been included to ensure the protection of natural and cultural resources and other\\nland uses.\\n\\nAuthority.\\nTitle 43 CFR 4100.0-8 states: \"The authorized officer shall manage livestock grazing on public\\nlands under the principle of multiple use and sustained yield, and in accordance with applicable\\nland use plans. Land use plans shall establish allowable resource uses (either singly or in\\ncombination), related levels of production or use to be maintained, areas of use, and resource\\ncondition goals and objectives to be obtained. The plans also set forth program constraints and\\ngeneral management practices needed to achieve management objectives. Livestock grazing\\nactivities and management actions approved by the authorized officer shall be in conformance\\nwith the land use plan as defined at 43 CFR 1601.0-5(b).\"\\n\\nTitle 43 CFR 4110.2-2(a) states: \"Permitted use is granted to holders of grazing preference and\\nshall be specified in all grazing permits or leases. Permitted use shall encompass all authorized\\nuse including livestock use, and any suspended use, except for permits and leases for designated\\nephemeral rangelands where livestock use is authorized based upon forage availability, or\\ndesignated annual rangelands. Permitted livestock use shall be based upon the amount of forage\\navailable for livestock grazing as established in the land use plan, activity plan or decision of the\\nauthorized officer under § 4110.3-3, except, in the case of designated ephemeral or annual\\nrangelands, a land use plan or activity plan may alternatively prescribe vegetation standards to be\\nmet in the use of such rangelands.\"\\n\\nTitle 43 CFR 4130.2(a) states: \"Grazing permits or leases shall be issued to qualified applicants\\nto authorize use on the public lands and other lands under the administration of the Bureau of\\nLand Management that are designated as available for livestock grazing through land use plans.\\nPermits and leases will specify the types and levels of use authorized, including livestock\\ngrazing, suspended use, and conservation and protection nonuse. These grazing permits and\\nleases will also specify terms and conditions pursuant to §§4130.3, 4130.3-1, and 4130.3-2.\"\\n\\nTitle 43 CFR 4130.2(d) states: \"The term of the grazing permits or leases authorizing livestock\\non the public lands and other lands under the administration of the Bureau of Land Management\\nshall be 10 years unless -- (1) The land is being considered for disposal; (2) The land will be\\ndevoted to a public purpose which precludes grazing prior to the end of 10 years; (3) The term of\\nthe base property lease is less than 10 years, in which case the term of the Federal permit or lease\\nshall coincide with the term of the base property lease; or (4) the authorized officer determines\\nthat a permit or lease for less than 10 years is the best interest of sound land management.\"\\n\\nPage | 4\\n\\nTitle 43 CFR 4130.3 states: \"Livestock grazing permits and leases shall contain terms and\\nconditions determined by the authorized officer to be appropriate to achieve the management and\\nresource condition objectives for the public lands and other lands administered by the Bureau of\\nLand Management, and to ensure conformance with the provisions of subpart 4180 of this part.\"\\n\\nTitle 43 CFR 4130.3-1(a) states: \"The authorized officer shall specify the kind and number of\\nlivestock, the period(s) of use, the allotment(s) to be used, and the amount of use, in animal unit\\nmonths, for every grazing permit or lease. The authorized livestock grazing use shall not exceed\\nthe livestock carrying capacity of the allotment.\"\\n\\nTitle 43 CFR 4130.3-2 states: \"The authorized officer may specify in grazing permits or leases\\nother terms and conditions which will assist in achieving management objectives, provide for\\nproper range management or assist in the orderly administration of the public rangelands.\"\\n\\nTitle 43 CFR 4160.1(a) states: \"Proposed decisions shall be served on any affected applicant,\\npermittee or lessee and any agent and lien holder of record, who is affected by the proposed\\nactions, terms or conditions, or modifications relating to applications, permits and agreements\\n(including range improvement permits) or leases, by certified mail or personal delivery. Copies\\nof the proposed decisions shall also be sent to the interested public\".\\n\\nProtest and/or Appeal.\\nAny applicant, permittee, lessee or other interested publics may protest a proposed decision\\nunder Sec. 43 CFR 4160.1 and 4160.2, in person or in writing to Brian Hopkins, Assistant Field\\nOffice Manager, Bureau of Land Management, 2300 River Frontage Road, Silt, Colorado 81652\\nwithin 15 days after receipt of such decision. The protest, if filed, should clearly and concisely\\nstate the reason(s) as to why the proposed decision is in error.\\n\\nIn accordance with 43 CFR 4160.3 (a), in the absence of a protest, the proposed decision will\\nbecome the final decision of the authorized officer without further notice unless otherwise\\nprovided in the proposed decision.\\n\\nIn accordance with 43 CFR 4160.3 (b) upon a timely filing of a protest, after a review of protests\\nreceived and other information pertinent to the case, the authorized officer shall issue a final\\ndecision.\\n\\nAny applicant, permittee, lessee or other person whose interest is adversely affected by the final\\ndecision may file an appeal in accordance with 43 CFR 4.470 and 43 CFR 4160.3 and 4160 .4.\\nThe appeal must be filed within 30 days following receipt of the final decision, or within 30 days\\nafter the date the proposed decision becomes final. The appeal may be accompanied by a\\npetition for a stay of the decision in accordance with 43 CFR 4.471 and 4.479, pending final\\ndetermination on appeal. The appeal and petition for a stay must be filed in the office of the\\nauthorized officer, as noted above. The person/party must also serve a copy of the appeal on any\\nperson named [43 CFR 4.421(h)] in the decision and the Office of the Solicitor, United States\\n\\nPage | 5\\n\\nDepartment of Interior, 755 Parfet Street, Suite 151, Lakewood, Colorado 80215. The BLM does\\nnot accept appeals by facsimile or email.\\n\\nThe appeal shall state the reasons, clearly and concisely, why the appellant thinks the final\\ndecision is in error and otherwise complies with the provisions of 43 CFR 4.470.\\n\\nShould you wish to file a petition for a stay, see 43 CFR 4.471 (a) and (b). In accordance with\\n43 CFR 4.471(c), a petition for a stay must show sufficient justification based on the following\\nstandards:\\n1. The relative harm to the parties if the stay is granted or denied.\\n2. The likelihood of the appellant\\'s success on the merits.\\n3. The likelihood of immediate and irreparable harm if the stay is not granted, and\\n4. Whether the public interest favors granting the stay.\\n\\nAs noted above, the petition for stay must be filed in the office of the authorized officer and\\nserviced in accordance with 43 CFR 4.473. Any person named in the decision from which an\\nappeal is taken (other than the appellant) who wishes to file a response to the petition for a stay\\nmay file with the Hearings division a motion to intervene in the appeal, together with the\\nresponse, within 10 days after receiving the petition. Within 15 days after filing the motion to\\nintervene and response, the person must serve copies on the appellant, the office of the Solicitor\\nand any other person named in the decision (43 CFR 4.472(b)).\\n\\nPlease take a moment to review your enclosed grazing permit.
